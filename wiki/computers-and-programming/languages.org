#+TITLE: Language Exploration
#+TODO: TODO | DONE

#+begin_quote
Not sure how to go about this page. Earlier I thought to just cover my personal
exploration and usage, but now feel like probably an encyclopedic coverage might
be better as I don't and won't go deep in all the languages.
#+end_quote

One of the parts of programming that I enjoy is learning/exploring new
languages. This page aims to keep a log of that process (ignoring the languages
whose interesting features are probably already present in others).

Depending on what you want from a language, there are the following general
areas to look for:

1. The /core ideologies/ which define the language.
2. General /code organization/, package system etc.
3. Good practices, /libraries and ecosystem/.
4. Knowledge of /internals and extensions/ which lets you simulate missing
   features.

For most of the languages here in the list, I want to have experience 1. A few
languages that I regularly use will have all 4 points covered (eventually).
Nevertheless, I will try to keep links and documentation for any and all points
that I do explore for each language.

* TODO Ada

Specifically, I am interested in its generic system.

* TODO APL/J/K

Interested to look at this family because of:
- Dedicated array manipulation functionality
- Non ASCII characters

* C

I recently tried to /actually/ use C while doing some Advent of Code problems and
working with Emacs Lisp dynamic modules. Its actually much nicer than I
expected. Although there is no modern-ish package management, the type of
packages I have been needing at this level are easy to get.

A few resources that I am finding helpful based on whatever background I have:
+ [[https://matt.sh/howto-c][How to C]] and the [[https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/][Modern C]] book.
+ A few useful nuggets from [[http://c-faq.com/][comp.lang.c Frequently Asked Questions]].

* C++

I have had some experience with C++ and know the general basics. As of now, I
don't have anything specific to try learning its more advanced features. I /might/
try it to learn some design patterns.

* Clojure

Creating a new section since I somehow have ended up using this more than others
from the Lisp family. Coming from Emacs Lisp and Common Lisp, [[https://github.com/clojure-cookbook/clojure-cookbook][Clojure Cookbook]]
was much better resource than the more famous ones like [[https://www.braveclojure.com][Brave Clojure]]. YMMW.

* TODO COBOL

Want to see how /English like/ it really is.

* Common Lisp

I have been using Common Lisp occasionally and strongly recommend trying. Things
that I am missing are probably from the popular books that I will try to cover
soon. Specially /Let Over Lambda/ and /The Art of Metaobject Protocol/.

Lack of community hurts though.

General resources:
- Use [[https://github.com/roswell/roswell][roswell]] for building command line tools.
- [[https://github.com/takagi/lake][lake]] is a neat make alternative.
- I keep a list of utility packages that I ~:use~ in repl (and shell-ish scripts)
  [[https://github.com/lepisma/cfg/blob/master/pod/package.lisp][here]]. Probably you could use something like [[https://github.com/cl21/cl21][cl21]] but then you would want to
  write packages in cl21 too.
- CL is also great for scripting if you live in the repl. I wrote my workflow
  [[pile:journal:2018/10/07/lisp-shell-scripts][here]].

* TODO Coq

* TODO D

* TODO Dylan

Have heard a lot about [[https://opendylan.org/articles/macro-system/index.html][dylan macros]]. Considering that its syntax is pretty non
Lispy, its really interesting to know how macros feel in here. This might
probably be similar to how they feel in R or Julia, or maybe not.

* TODO Eiffel

/Contracts/ are the basic motivation here.

* TODO Elm

* TODO Elixir

* Emacs Lisp

One of those language that tell you how pleasant programming can be even in a
badly designed system /if/ the language is well integrated in the environment and
community is alive.

General resources:
- Use [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s]], [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash]], [[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][f]] and [[https://github.com/Wilfred/ht.el][ht]] while programming in elisp for maximum pleasure.
- [[https://phst.eu/emacs-modules.html][Here]] is a great documentation for creating and working with dynamic modules.

* TODO Erlang

I have been playing with Erlang a little bit recently. The syntax at first looks
weird but makes much more sense after you try Prolog first. The killer feature,
actor based concurrency, is something I haven't really tried yet.

Looking for a nice problem to proceed here.

As far as other BEAM languages are concerned, Elixir looks neat but probably
won't have much to throw at me if I look into the ML family first.

* Factor

I used factor once very long ago and didn't appreciate it then. Recently used
some of its features and am impressed. The special point to mention is how
clearly the /code is data/ idea translates here. Other than trying out its
extensive set of libraries, I am interested in learning more about /quotations/
and trying to implement the language itself.

* TODO Haskell

Not sure if I will be using this IRL, but is a nice language to learn a lot of
ideas from. A few resources that I have touched:

1. Obviously [[http://learnyouahaskell.com/][Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!]] Not sure if this really helped
   though. Too much of someone else controlling the speed made me stop somewhere
   midway.
2. [[https://github.com/soupi/haskell-study-plan][Haskell Study Plan]]. This one is much more self paced, flexible and practical.

* TODO Idris

* Io

Touched Io in 'Seven Languages in Seven weeks'. It is a good case study for
learning about

- Message passing system
- Prototype based objects

There are other interesting features like the actor based concurrency model but
I am more inclined to try that in Erlang, so nothing much to do here.

* Java

I get to use it at a few places occasionally. Java has evolved but there are so
much better languages right now on JVM that I probably will never touch it
again.

* JavaScript/TypeScript

Modern JS has come a long way and has some seriously powerful features. I have
been using it along with TypeScript and like both a lot. As of now, there is no
specific language feature on my list. Probably after digging deeper into the
runtime there will be some.

* TODO Julia

Have used it as a Python user would. Like R, the interesting things here are in
the language core and how the AST manipulation works. Will be looking into those
soon.

* TODO Lua

Lua probably is pretty well used in the game community and has some really nice
engines. Will be trying it while working on a game.

* Nim

I have tried it in pieces here and there. Looks like follows the following
relation ~crystal:ruby::nim:python~. I don't have any specific use case for it
though so probably won't be jumping deeper here.

* OCaml

OCaml got me into pattern matching and algebraic data types. That's probably
enough of this since I find Haskell more interesting now.

* TODO Prolog

I have an okayish understanding of Prolog now but sometimes the programs get
stuck pretty deep while backtracking. Will need to dig into the language and
implementation to see what's missing.

* Python

Probably my main language as of now. Is pretty practical so has some annoying
warts. Not much to dig here.

General resources:
- [[https://chrisyeh96.github.io/2017/08/08/definitive-guide-python-imports.html][The Definitive Guide to Python import Statements]] is a neat guide explaining
  the import mess in Python.
- Want more structure in python programs? Use [[https://github.com/ericvsmith/dataclasses][dataclasses]]/[[https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs][attrs]] and [[https://github.com/python/mypy][mypy]].
- [[https://github.com/dgilland/pydash][pydash]] has nice set of high level functions.
- [[https://github.com/mahmoud/glom][glom]] helps in working with nested data.
- For workflow management, I find [[https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/][snakemake]] really useful. Combining it with
  [[https://conda.io/][conda]] gives nice pavement for exploratory projects. +For scripts, [[https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/][pipenv]] is
  probably the cleanest solution+.
- Use [[https://poetry.eustace.io/][poetry]] for developing python libraries and/or scripts. It avoids ~setup.py~
  and its brothers altogether.
- For managing python versions, I have found [[https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer][pyenv]] to be very clean. Along with
  poetry for managing virtualenvs, this helps in closing the loop.
- I like [[https://github.com/docopt/docopt][docopt]] for command line parsing. Even though there are probably valid
  arguments /against/ it, since it's not very popular, I haven't really felt any
  problem with it til now.

* R

R's problem domain already has mirrors in Python so its not worth that much. The
more interesting part however comes in the language itself. A lot of nice
package APIs in R are result of the meta programming support in R.

[[http://adv-r.had.co.nz/][Advanced R]] has a section on metaprogramming which should be a good place to
begin.

* TODO Racket

Separating this from the Lisp family because its not a Lisp in the strict sense.
Few reasons for learning this specifically:
- [ ] Hygienic macros
- [ ] First class continuations
- [ ] Typed racket

Although I have used it occasionally, I haven't really committed to it. A piece
that keeps tempting me here are the carefully crafted documentations and proses
surrounding this.

* TODO  REBOL / Red

* Ruby

Last I used, it felt like a better Python. Better lambdas, better shell
integration and better class system. Though Python's package ecosystem is too
expansive and complete that I mostly won't be doing anything here.

* TODO Rust

A bit of fad at the moment, but has modern features for everything possible with
something like C++. Not sure if I will be able to start properly without pushing
this somehow in workplace.

* Scala

Tried this while going through the book 'Seven Languages in Seven Weeks'. Its
focused a lot on practicalities and so is more of a mixture of tricks rather
than having a definite ideological inclination. You can't love more than a
couple /practical/ languages. I am already full.

* TODO Shen

Don't remember where I got the reference from for this. A cursory glance tells
probably there are a few /novel/ features rather than a compendium.

* TODO Squeak/Smalltalk

The key /experience/ here might not be Object Oriented Programming but the
immersive, live IDE(s).

* TODO TeX

* TODO Webassembly

Not a language to learn as such, but am wanting to get in the compiler side
using this pathway.

* TODO Zig
