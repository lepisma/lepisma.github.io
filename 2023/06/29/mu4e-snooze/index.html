<p>
An update on this using the newer <code>o1-preview</code> model is <a class="pile-link" href="/journal/2024/09/13/mu4e-snooze-with-o1-preview/index.html">here</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From around February-March this year, I have been attempting conscious <i>letting
go</i> of reservations around modern productivity tools. For example, I switched to
using <a href="https://www.shortwave.com/">shortwave</a> from Gmail web for managing work email, switched to <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> from
Org Mode for task management, started using <a href="https://www.sunsama.com/">Sunsama</a> instead of a paper planner,
etc. A few of these worked well and a few didn't. Many that worked had a simple
<i>one-feature difference</i> from the older method.
</p>

<p>
Specifically for email, I realized that the <i>one-feature difference</i> was the
ability to snooze an email. I understand that snoozing is available in most
tools now, but it was <i>shortwave</i> that made me utilize this feature properly.
Knowing that I can follow the <a href="https://www.shortwave.com/method/">shortwave method</a> anywhere I have snooze feature, I
decided to implement snoozing in my favorite email tool, <a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/">mu4e</a>.
</p>

<aside id="org38d4626">
<p>
The implementation is <a href="https://github.com/lepisma/mu4e-snooze/tree/master">here</a> in case you also want to use snoozing in mu4e.
</p>
</aside>

<p>
Since I was on a break last week<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>, I tried
taking more time here to work on the project with GPT4's help to gain more
insights in <i>AI co-programming</i> as a technique and current capabilities of GPT4
itself. This blog notes down few observations from that experiment.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Overall, there is nothing new here that hasn't been discussed already in the
community. But nevertheless it was fun to understand the current state and build
insights on my own.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-email-snoozing" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-email-snoozing"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Email Snoozing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-email-snoozing">

<p>
Before starting, let's understand what email snoozing means and how we can
design a system to do this.
</p>

<p>
Snoozing refers to the action of moving an email out of inbox with a commitment
on date and time when it would appear back in inbox. This is helpful to move
things out of sight that you can't attend to right now anyway. This maps to
<i>defer</i> action in the inbox-zero vocabulary. This is not a feature that you would
get out-of-the-box in email servers, or clients for that matter.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-email-snoozing/mu4e-and-the-setup" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-email-snoozing/mu4e-and-the-setup"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Mu4e and the Setup</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sec-email-snoozing/mu4e-and-the-setup">

<p>
Email setups based on mu4e are made up of three components:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir">Maildir</a> syncing setup using, say, <a href="https://www.offlineimap.org/">OfflineIMAP</a>. This maps your remote email
directories to your local filesystem in the Maildir format.</li>
<li>A CLI tool <code>mu</code> for indexing and searching over a Maildir.</li>
<li>An elisp package (<code>mu4e</code>) to wrap around <code>mu</code> so that you can <i>do email</i> inside
Emacs.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Making snoozing feature in this setup is an interesting challenge for an AI
because of the following reasons, all more or less related to familiarity and
<i>generalization</i>:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>This feature is not that common on public code repositories. I got 264k
repository hits when searching for 'todo app' but 16 when searching for
'email snooze' on GitHub.</li>
<li>Emacs Lisp is not a common language for programming. This might pose
challenges to the AI<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> on the language syntax front.</li>
<li>Maildir + Mu4e is relatively niche setup as far as desktop email clients go.
This means that the AI might not be aware completely of structural aspects
like data organization here.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-email-snoozing/design" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-email-snoozing/design"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Design</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sec-email-snoozing/design">

<p>
Knowing a few things about how email works and my own mail setup, I was able to
come up with a first pass design for this system like the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There will be a new <i>label</i> where all snoozed emails from inbox will go to. This
is how a lot other wrapper over GMail used to implement snoozing.</li>
<li>I will add an mu4e action that asks me date and time and moves marked emails
to the snoozed label. The date and time saved will be stored somewhere in a
database. Little later I made this information go in X-headers<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>.</li>
<li>An Emacs timer will go through the emails in the snoozed label every few
minutes and move the expired items to inbox.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Generally we are talking about 3 abstractions:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Staging area</i> for moving snoozed emails.</li>
<li>Tracking date time information for each snoozed email.</li>
<li>A timer setup that runs through the snoozed emails and move them to inbox if
they have gone beyond the planned time.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-gpt4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-gpt4"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> GPT4</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-gpt4">

<p>
Keeping in mind the rough design mentioned above, my initial expectations was
that GPT4 should be good enough to handle the project end to end. It could come
with different concrete choices for the abstractions mentioned above, but
generally it should get the job done without much intervention.
</p>

<p>
I don't know why I had such high expectations, even though I actively believed
this problem might be challenging for GPT4.
</p>

<p>
But as I started working on this, I got disillusioned. Here are a few
observations, in no specific order:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There were many <i>confident</i> mistakes. If you poke holes, you will get an
apology and a slightly improved solution. But then you will have to know the
system to really be able to trust GPT4 output.</li>
<li>The output code, and notes along with it, was very hand-wavy. "Do this and
that and done, simple.". Almost like the end goal was not to actually run the
code but to provide <i>some</i> explanation or pseudo-code to the seeker. And
inevitably this was missing a whole lot of details that were super critical
for the code to run.</li>
<li>Unless it's totally autonomous&#x2014;we are not there yet&#x2014;you will have to dive
in the <i>solution specifications</i> in addition to <i>problem specifications</i>. And
writing a solution specification is difficult. I had to see the written code
multiple times to finally say that "Hey, I want this and not that because
<i>xyz</i>". I guess this gets easier as you co-program for a while.</li>
<li>Probably a minor point, but there was a background anxiety around seeing code
close enough to have stylistic annoyances but not the right kind of control
to do anything about them. I am assuming this will improve drastically in the
future. We probably just don't have the right <i>language</i> for conveying <i>how</i>
right now. In the end <i>how</i> won't even matter but is still an important
area&#x2014;personally&#x2014;for the time being.</li>
<li>Finally I had to write the program on my own anyway, so that was the biggest
disappointment. I could see places where small portions of the problems were
done well but together they were not solving the problem completely.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Though in terms of the 3 challenging aspects of this problem mentioned earlier,
I believe Emacs Lisp didn't pose any. There were no stupid language related
mistakes, even though there were many semantic mistakes around how few
sub-problems could be solved.
</p>

<p>
You can see my interaction log in the <a href="#sec-appendix">Appendix</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-patterns" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-patterns"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Patterns</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-patterns">

<p>
In spite of the annoying experience, there were many patterns that seemed
promising. Almost all are some form of <i>cognitive heuristics</i> working on a layer
above the core reasoning system. Few are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Keep asking questions around the implementation, ask to explain, ask to 'make
things better or correct'. These don't need any specific details but work
well. Approaches like <i>Chain of Thoughts</i> fall in similar category.</li>
<li>Spend time setting boundaries via asking to write tests. LLMs can do a decent
job of self criticism. Same model with different context can evaluate its own
output well, unlike classical ML setting. In ways this is obvious and
expected in <i>in-context-learning</i> as you should probably look at same LLM with
different contexts as <i>different</i> classical ML models.</li>
<li>Coupled with the previous point, a lot of issues seem fixable with access to
runtime system. I believe products geared towards proper programming
assistance (GPT4 via ChatGPT is obviously not) would utilize this a lot.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-future" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-future"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Future</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-future">

<p>
Let's keep analysis&#x2014;code reviews, static analysis, testing, etc.&#x2014;and
assistance&#x2014;copilot and other similar current generation IDE features&#x2014;out of
the picture. In terms of pure automation, I believe there are problems where you
can get automation to the level of <i>subsumption</i> even right now where you don't
need to worry about the underlying substrate, code, at all. For example an
interface for plotting data in common ways is possible with an AI writing
throwable matplotlib code on every prompt<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>. But to get to similar level for a lot of what we do in
programming, there is still much to be done.
</p>

<p>
An interesting question I have is around the future of <i>cognitive heuristics</i>
mentioned earlier. Will they remain part of <i>architecture over LLMs</i> or will they
be subsumed inside? I believe it will be the latter, but I would like to
understand the shelf life of such things in practical products for the next,
say, 2-3 years.
</p>

<p>
It will also be interesting to deconstruct the abilities needed to make a 'todo
app' vs 'snooze feature' which can help to define what to solve. A major part of
this will be <i>familiarity in training data</i>, like with humans. But in the end I
don't want to have an AI system that does better on creating shopping websites
since they are more common on GitHub. So this is not enough. Pretty sure there
is some study here that I need to find which might be guiding next upgrades in
LLMs that can program.
</p>
<hr>

<p>
This post is a relatively shallow evaluation. Folks working on programming LLMs
can give you much better insights, and I am not one of them, yet. But I can make
few general statements: Working with GPT4 doesn't feel like a Product Manager
working with an Engineer. Neither does it feel like an Engineer working with
another. Nor like an Engineer working with a Junior Engineer. It's in reality
more like:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
an Engineer working with a Junior Engineer who is asked to write code, send
results without reflections, and without access to a runtime, but <i>with</i> access to
stackoverflow.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I am very confident that this would start to feel like the <i>PM working with a
Good Engineer</i> pattern soon, but there are a few more steps to get there.
