Guess it's time. The patchwork is showing its nature.

1. Things have become sluggish.
2. I no longer know what loads before what.
3. Wrong splits between packages and config.
4. Unmaintainable colors, themes, and other goodies.
5. There are many new avenues for making things look pretty which I am not up to
   date with.

I will probably start looking at modern solutions for most of the components
that I am looking to replace. First step will be to decide whether to continue
with spacemacs or not, which means looking at their development roadmap.
