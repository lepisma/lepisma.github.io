#+TAGS: org-mode, programming

I tend to keep occasional image clippings from pdf documents, images or internet
posts along with certain notes in org files and, at times, it gets really hard
to move them around because of the links to some relative directory and all. I
am now trying to make these files self contained by putting the bytes inside the
org files in a separate block. Here is the [[https://github.com/lepisma/iorg][package]] if you want to give it a try.
The screencast below shows the system in action:

In some ways this violates the /plain-text/ idea of these files but it's not that
bad really. Unless, of course, you start embedding things like fonts, audio
clippings etc. [fn::Hmm] and start going fully towards something like /odf/.

This is missing a few features to make it /actually/ usable. A notable one is
support for org exports (at least for html so that I can use them in this
website).
