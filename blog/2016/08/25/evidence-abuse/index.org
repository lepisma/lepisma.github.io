Three recent events. Each trying to push psuedo-science using different
approaches. But with a common element of grayness in how they discuss topics
related to science.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Warning: This post contains strong language at places. It's also long.
#+END_QUOTE

Weird things happen when you are at home. You get to talk to /real/ people and get
out of your utopic daydream. I have recently been unable to argue with people on
a few topics. I wonder if I am getting too old for this shit. Most of these
happen when I touch a /gray/ portion of certain communicated opinions. It gets
hard to convince people about a general sense of blackness or whiteness. In
every argument, you can easily weasel out solid points for your favour. And if
people have even a single point in favour, they are willing to stick it with
their sense of identity and refuse to accept any change. (I need an ego
deflation session, mail me)

Some cases are easy to argue against. You just roll your eyes. Some are
not-so-easy. Let me give a general sense of what type of content I am talking
about. Consider vegetarian and non-vegetarian eating habits. Simplest of the
arguments will split opinions among factions. The neutrals are easy to get
baptized to either side. Only when you give enough time, the fog begins to
clear. Till then, the arguments go on like meteor showers. Never hitting
anything. It's not necessary that one side is ultimately right and other is
wrong. But there is something special about the ways bad arguments work here,
which makes it easy to know who is putting real arguments and who is shuffling
flip-flops. Meanwhile the flip-flop guy isn't aware of things and has trust on
the points of virtue of his / her cause. This makes it hard. /"Hey you are being
good, but it's not the right way"/, ever heard this work?

Things boil down to poor journalism and communication. Information communication
is how you learn about things and use them to make arguments. Poor examples of
communication almost always mishandle evidence. I will mention 3 major cases
here that I repeatedly face.

Before I begin, I want to specifically focus on the point that the topic of my
interest in all these cases, for this post, is the /presentation of information/
and not the information itself. This post might also look like doing undue
exaggeration of the issue, I will try to convince you it's not the case. Also, I
am no expert on many things and have been involved in stupidity pretty much
regularly. So don't take things here as absolute truths, but opinions of sort.

"The Fact of Melatonin* Plz make it a point to sleep early... ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜Š Thats how God
has made us... Sleep at night and work during the day...â˜º Today I learnt
something new... A natural cancer vaccine. God placed in each and everyone of us
a gland in our head called the Pineal gland. It is considered to be the
biological clock of the human body and it is also connected to the sight nerve.
It is small like the size of a pea. Everyday after sundown this gland starts
producing a substance called Melatonin which runs in the bloodstream and
protects the body from cancer. ðŸ˜‹ This gland works only in the dark so if the
eye is exposed to light the gland does not work because it thinks night has not
come yet...ðŸ¤” So if you stay up at night in the light, you are depriving your
body from this daily vaccine... Our parents and grandparents who used to sleep
early in the night and wake up early in the morning did not suffer from cancer
or any of the disease we hear about today. God has placed this daily vaccine in
our body to protect us so let's put it to use by sleeping early.ðŸ’ª The gland
starts working from after dark until two hours before sunrise !!!ðŸŒž Must read
and share this miraculous physiology God designed inside man... ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š"
#+END_QUOTE

Is there anything wrong here? If you are careful, you might find a few mistakes.
But someone sent you this with good intentions. Honestly, I am happy someone
other than my parents (ok, the sender was not one of my parents) give a damn
about when I put my head on pillow. And this message has no side effects and
isn't really wrong, isn't it?

I know you have started hating me already. Anyways, what drives you to believe a
thing like this? Scientific evidence, right? Right?

You might have heard of melatonin if you use some screen filter like [[https://justgetflux.com][flux]],
[[http://jonls.dk/redshift/][redshift]], [[https://github.com/raatmarien/red-moon][red-moon]] etc. for filtering out blueish lights in night. Melatonin
gets released in darkness, has things with sleep wake cycle and certain results
find blue side of the spectrum affecting its release. A well informed source for
reading on the topic is [[http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/30730][this]] answer. Notice how the researches talk about
statistical significance and uncertainties.

What about cancer? Wikipedia usually does a good job for communicating popular
knowledge and opinions. By design it can be rigged by one side of a research.
But, when it notes a contradiction among results, you can be assured to find
multiple arguments floating around among researchers. Head over to the Wikipedia
article on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin#Cancer][melatonin]]. First, there is not much consensus. A bit of web search
will tell you that there are few researches supporting its assistance in certain
forms of cancer (mostly breast cancer). But in any case, the results never state
it as a /'vaccine for cancer'/. Go on. Mail me papers. Convince me. At least an
/in-vivo/ trial that concludes it as a cure for cancer. Even, many of the quacks
(I know a few) use 'maybe' when talking melatonin and cancer connection, because
otherwise whats stopping them from solving the whole world's cancer with a
[[https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=buy+melatonin+online][cheap, over-the-counter medicine]]?

Oh, and you can also find pretty damn sure articles that say it's a miraculous
thing against cancer. We will talk about those cases in section 2.

How do you communicate a research which is not strongly established? Obviously
you factor in the risk and play it safe by saying that /"thing X might lead to
cancer"/. /Might/, because scientists are not sure. /Might/, because the explosive
mutability of information can't be controlled. /Might/, because you really
understand the uncertainties and are willing to go an extra mile to shackle the
chains around us. But we say

** Simplification.

#+CAPTION: [[https://xkcd.com/547/][xkcd 547]]
#+ATTR_HTML: :class zoomTarget :data-closeclick true
[[file:./simple.png]]

No one can know everything. So we use a few tricks. We learn how to utilize
sources and do reasoning. In fact this is what we are taught in schools.
Everything else, you learn on the go. We work on coarse models of the world when
we can't understand or afford a finer one.

The model we use are made of bricks of a certain kind of framework that you
choose to be true. Like science, religion, morality etc. The model itself tries
to faithfully represent the observed behaviour of a certain system. For a
particular system, many models work, irrespective of the backing framework or
observational errors.

Consider climate change. Established observations [[http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/][say]] that the temperature is
increasing globally over the years. Say we have to understand and communicate
this observation to the masses. We start by creating a model that explains the
observation. Now the analysts choose their weapon of choice and create models
with various levels of abstractions. Some go with hard atmospheric sciences,
some believe we are in a simulation and go with that, some work using human
morality and some with religion.

Next, onto communication. Most of the frameworks have certain techniques to
abstract away their finest models so as to reach a wider audience. A common
method is used by religions in many practical cases which reduces their model
abstractions to simple human morality. When a writer tries to tell people about
a system, he / she uses a model which is approachable by the /target audience/.

- An airplane flies using its /'certain kind'/ of wings. Want more?
- The wings when /'pushed forward'/ create a /'situation'/ in air around it, that
  makes it go up. Want more?
- The wings are shaped in /'such a way'/ that the air speed above and below it are
  different and /'an established theory'/ explains the observed lift. Want more?
- ...
- Here is the actual documentation with mechanisms and /'assumptions'/.

Notice the quoted words. You can't abstract away models without allowing
uncertainties, it's a myth loved by most of the promoters of ancient-wisdom and
preachers that I know of. If you are able to, you model was fat and bloated. A
good communication lets you know at what level of abstraction you are reading
and how to shift up gears if you can afford it. More importantly, it makes you
able to ask the right sort of questions.

Another kind of uncertainty comes with the research itself. Digging deeper makes
you see that there are many models, within a framework, competing to explain
observations using certain sub-frameworks. The original model creator warns you
about these. The assumptions are laid bare and the competing ideas are visible
to naked eyes. The person responsible for popularizing the model passes these on
faithfully to a higher abstraction level. The results are not statistically
significant? No issue. /"Mate, the scientists tried to compare this. The results
are slightly negative but more inconclusive. Though it's nice to be safe"/.

Whenever you see an absolute truth walking down, descending from heaven itself
to grace the internet with its aura, you got a task at hand. Fish out for
uncertainties. You know they are there, they can't hide if not for assumptions
(in which case, the assumptions can't hide). Simplification doesn't take away
uncertainties, but tries to save them.

The content I mentioned in the beginning seems to have an idiosyncratic way of
simplification. Similar contents can be seen in their natural habitat of quick
witted media. IM forwards, social networking posts, micro blogs etc. I remember
this line from [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17470674-fahrenheit-451][Fahrenheit 451]] talking about things that the characters were
missing in the fiction

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Number one, as I said, quality of information. Number two: leisure to
digest it. [...]

#+HTML:<footer>Faber - Fahrenheit 451</footer>
#+END_QUOTE

Leisure to digest comes with a responsibility of *not* using the leisure to start
devouring another piece of information or throwing paper planes out of windows.

The message I mentioned has following /non-factoid/ issues that hurt me (sorry
sender), despite my respect for the concern of the sender:

- /Swapping of model back end/: A model must be passed on as it was created. We
  can't mix and match things to suite the prejudices of audience or ourselves.
  Like in this case, some non-creationist atheist (like me) can get pissed off
  and avoid reading the content altogether.

- /Term abuse, Vaccine/: I remember a guy in train preaching people (college
  juniors) that Newton's law of gravitation is wrong and you can't use that.
  Apparently, someone didn't use the right set of words while explaining him the
  idea that theories have certain limits, assumptions and validity over scale.
  And Newton's law is not really adequate for some specific needs.

- /Misinterpretation of data/: Dying at 30 from T.B. saves us from common old age
  death causes. Cancer too, yes.

- /Absolute facts/: I can believe this message lies on the side where researchers
  are certain about cancer effect, but then the reader should get hints for the
  general disagreement, which is pretty much known (specially for the original
  content creator).

** Evidence
#+CAPTION: [[https://xkcd.com/925/][xkcd 925]]
#+ATTR_HTML: :class zoomTarget :data-closeclick true
[[file:./cell_phones.png]] 

Evidence keeps wild information mutations in check. It's not so much about
actually putting up the citations before passing the message. Citations can also
be successfully abstracted. More important is to ensure that there is no drought
of evidence. Ensure that there are sufficient amount of them before passing on
information, or creating a higher level abstraction. And ensure that the
receiver bears the same comfort and responsibility with evidence.

Evidence, not to be confused with observations, ties the whole model building
process together. Absence of evidence allows you to do mix and match,
exaggerations, misinterpretations and misjudgments.

I mean, what would have been wrong if the message would be circulating without
the issues we talked about. Heeding to evidence would have kept the facts in
check (like whether Pineal gland or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus][SCN]] is known as the 'clock'), would have
included the required uncertainty of results, and even then could have made the
point it originally intended (making me sleep earlier). How many people are now
convinced that there is such a thing like /'vaccine'/ for cancer? How many people
are assured enough to not look upon /'Melatonin'/ on even Wikipedia since the
information provided is complete and absolute? How many irrational nostalgic
sentiments about healthy life of yesterdays have been fueled again? How many
people have been convinced that every move we make, is against the grand scheme
of someone's God? In my personal experiences with people, I can safely say, a
hell lot!

I was recently involved in a facebook discussion about effects of microwave on
food items. The issues included bad effects of microwave on food and
carcinogenic quality of plastic + microwave interaction. Without touching the
topic, let me tell you the state of the final facebook post. There are around 20
citations floating around. Many of which are not going to affect the arguments.
Sadly, the original link shared was enough to convince most of us that it's good
science. Citations, references, geeky words, what else do you need? I am sure
not more than 5 (not sure about the number) guys actually went through, or
needed to look at the citations. Also, I can assure you, many adventurous people
who opened the main link came out convinced that they were dealing with science.
To put it straight, many of us believe that there is no such thing as poor
science.

#+BEGIN_aside

#+END_aside

It's different from the first situation. You ask for evidence and the first guy
will realize the lack and would go on the defensive. This case will throw so
many of them, however shallow, you will get almost convinced of the argument
because you can't gather enough time to accept / refute them. The evidence feels
so solid on the surface, your mind will be confused whether they are actually
refutable if I do a web search with my /'limited'/ knowledge. Finally you succumb
to /better be safe than sorry/.

You can almost feel the shades of gray here. Promotion of science in the way
science intends is great, right? Look at all the T.V. programs, all the news
articles, everything is helping people to accept science in their daily lives.
Look again, and you can see an almost exuberant insincerity for evidence
spilling from the mouths of promoters. Of course not all of them.

** Pseudo Science 
Take that microwave oven case. Here is the [[http://www.medicaldaily.com/microwaves-are-bad-you-5-reasons-why-microwave-oven-cooking-harming-your-health-250145][link]] that was shared. If you actually
read that link, you might have already reached [[http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/05/18/microwave-hazards.aspx][this article]]. See how the content
itself is similar to the melatonin message, but the presentation is different.
Obviously, this link will also get to its level of WhatsApp forward, but it's
all pro-science in the article. This one is trying hard to stand on the
shoulders of giants. Evidence, references, articles, numbers, bio-photons? food
value? bio-information from sun? Microwave ban in Russia? dioxins? Most of the
times, these get convincing because of the jargons, our fear to look beyond them
and cherry picked exaggerations from quacks.

Go to some skeptic forums, they have good sources of information to read from
and they welcome heavy skepticism. Go to [[http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Microwave_oven][RationalWiki]], search [[https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/search?q=microwave&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all][/r/skeptic]] and
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkThis/search?q=microwave&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all][/r/DebunkThis]] (I have linked microwave specific results), follow whatever points
you can find against any argument. This is important, not because I am
convincing you to go against the original argument, but because in cases with a
deluge of superficial evidence, you will most like fail to notice the /'taken
out-of-context'/ information, which you can learn only when you hear the counter
arguments. Hell! I don't even want to link so many articles debunking this. It
would be sad. And ironic. You might say well, how do you know which links are
right, which links are wrong? I don't. You can never accept any content just as
it is. But, you can have a prior belief about certain kind of content which
makes you focus your skepticism where it's most needed. Go on, read all the
links you find. I am assured, after a while you can tell whether an article has
a higher chance of pseudo-science just by looking at its CSS. It's like finding
your perfect life partner. A beautiful breeze will touch you and put a smile on
your face (No kidding!).

Pseudo science tries hard to look like real science. Uses all the tools used by
science. It tries to convince people using something it doesn't understand. Just
a pinch of skepticism and the house of cards is destroyed.

Citations are not badges of authenticity, they are tools of abstraction
outsourcing. And when they are not helping in abstraction, there is no 'other'
use you can conjure out of thin air for them.

A few people who are good at conjuring the 'other' uses are:

- /Quacks/: Promoting their method of treatment, wellness etc. /The doctors/
- /Simple innocent beings/: Afraid, distressed by the hammer of 'science'. /The
  patients/
- /Wannabe scientists/: Don't care much about the real thing if it serves the
  public image and the inner scientist. /Vectors of disease/

The only people who are willing to listen are the /innocent beings/. And they need
access to real consolidated evidence. A truckload of evidence is used most of
the time when you are not sure about whether any of them is right (independent
of whether the thing is actually right or wrong). A gross misinterpretation of
scientific method and communication.

Consider the sources you are getting your information from. The sources which
support one pseudo-science are, by design, going to support other
pseudo-sciences if they feel like. See if you can find meaningless diversions
and misinterpretation of the evidence. Real bold scientific claims don't come in
a /Buzzfeed/ list. They don't devoid you of your ability to reach the original
research. They welcome it. Their basic hypothesis is clear and analyzable. And
they don't mix inconsistent web sources to create a coherent model of their
liking.

Of course, there are issues when you attack these sources. I already mentioned
the grayness of these arguments. You will definitely be able to find patches of
truth in the information provided and will wonder why I am being so diligent
with my attacks. I don't need theories with doubtful validity claiming '/17 life
energies from sun that gives you food/' to convince me of Sun's role. Just a
simple reminder of photosynthesis will do.

Explore the tweet above (basically the linked image). Come back later. Look,
what arguments can be put here to favour both sides. Colgate told not to rub
abrasives on your teeth. Later they tried incorporating [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_carbon][activated charcoal]] in
their products in a form /they/ found better. On the other side, baba tells us
about this hypocrisy that companies regularly employ to sell stuff. Obviously,
both arguments are good and bad in different ways.

Anyway, I see this message promoting two things

- There is a reason higher than scientific method to decide against or in favor
  of a product. In this case, ethnocentrism, nationalism and other similar ideas
  on different scales.

- You shouldn't feel a need to question anything if you are supportive of the
  first point.

You could argue that it's just an example of healthy rivalry. But, do you see
this message driving people to go for the real knowledge about what should they
use for cleaning teeth, and in which form (/buy our toothpastes/)? I don't see it.
Maybe you could pry it out if someone is willing to reveal it. But do you think
people care when they are /attacked/ by foreign companies and are /losing/ their
tradition?

Now, Baba gave us cool exercises. Great. Cheaper products don't hurt me. Neither
do I get a heart stroke when one company gives competition to other established
players. But on what cost to the popular thinking? I have seen people actually
getting conscious about health and that's cool. But no one can amputate my head
as if I don't give a damn about who controls my thoughts and stories. I live in
a country that has /earned/ its independence and I know what emotions you can stir
when you invoke nationalistic ideas. Talk about eternal cultural superiority,
shout national slogans, appeal to ancient science and you get an army of martyrs
without cause, ready to sabotage the people who ask "why".

The questions people need answers to are innocent. They aren't against anything,
as presumed by the preachers. They are just questions. But the techniques of
preachers don't have anything but disregard for them. You don't need to talk
about evidence, because they are talking much above these petty issues.

Advertisements do this all the time. They look for what sells and target
advertisements that way. There are pockets of worshippers built around products
and logo badges. By design and diversity, usually these pockets keep things
chaotic (though I accept there is a certain drift over time). But I am yet to
hear a person asking me to buy a certain biscuit by a certain company because of
a reason other than what the ingredients label yell or certain offers indicate.
Sure there is congenital imbecility to account for, but I have strong reasons to
believe that I can at least reason around with them.

This works in theory and, most of the time, in practice. Let me tell you why.
Because you didn't sell your soul to a certain school of thought with weird set
of priorities. Because your product decisions don't tie to and create your
identity. Because a demagogue can't yell a battle cry, right or wrong, and take
control of your life decisions.

** Cults
I have absolutely no problem with product promotion based on actual quality.
But, we know a few entities that tend to differ here. I saw a roadside banner
for some mobile company InFocus that said something like /"Why buy Chinese, when
you can get American?"/ (I read this on billboards in Varanasi and Lucknow, can't
seem to find it on internet. So, can't assure if it was put by the company or
some local store. In case you have read it too, please send me a pic for
inclusion). Is this a good reason? Since I am not touching anything sensitive,
we can get neutral and reasonable answers for this particular advertisement.
It's a no. You can have certain tendencies, but you don't make decisions using
them.

The models we talked about, there can be many kinds that work. There are many
lapses in almost all the backing frameworks. Some accept the lapses, make way
for other models to move in action. /Morality/ and /Science/ complement each other
real good this way. Some don't. And mainly the ones with most number of
deficiencies in term of framework capabilities. These framework claim to be
absolutely complete and purer than anything other. Complete. Right from their
inception to the present time, despite the popular knowledge that they visibly
mutate by piggybacking on badges of modern scientific developments (like quantum
physics, mail me if you want to know the secrets of the universe; I wonder what
would have happened if they had to popularize their ideas before 1920s).

in practice. They patch your ignorance with some mumbo-jumbo and you feel devoid
of vulnerabilities. Pure. Complete. All knowing sentient entity free from

Call me paranoid with [[https://xkcd.com/386/][SIWOTI syndrome]]. I am over touching everything. Maybe I
live among jerks and am butthurt. Maybe I just have a dystopian fetish. This
post shouldn't have been this long. In fact this could have been a much gentler
tea-time conversation just like we regularly have on climate change,
vaccination, GMO etc. Ah! the wonderful evenings. But I am fed up talking with
people who just want to drink tea. Look around yourself, throw pebbles in water.
See what floats, what sinks. Try to foresee the long term effects if
circulations like these keep on going unrestrained by a few who give a damn.
Sure, you can argue that there is nothing presently 'that' harmful done by these
issues (though I disagree). But, boy! You will be sorry then because no one will
be able to question the conspiracy of silence when it hits you.

First, look for evidence and the acceptance it receives in the content you got.
Second, see if the 'science' overwhelms you to a point where you risk accepting
it as granted. Third, check if somebody is sneaking a leash over how you are
going to analyze contents.

More than abuses to evidence, these are abuses to our sanity and intellect as a
population. Even if melatonin saves you from cancer, even if microwave oven
gives you cancer or even if the cult fictions are the ultimate facts, the point
stays. Final verdict can't be used to prove the righteousness of fickle
arguments.

- This leads to that.
- Scientists[1] say, this leads[2] to[3] that[4]. References.
- This, because [/insert your cult leader's wet dream/]

Ask yourself, if these contents pass through you unchecked, will you be able to
shed the guilt of depriving kids of genuine 'curiosity'? Guilt of fooling people
into believing they are 'scientists'? Guilt of closing your eyes to the truth
just because you are too lazy and want to be spoon fed by some know-it-all? Or
maybe it's all meaningless and you already are in a cult with mechanisms for
