#+TITLE: A month of /fountain/ pens
#+TAGS: personal

Last month, I ended up buying a bunch of fountain pens and ink bottles. While I
can clearly see the rabbit hole that is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/][/r/fountainpens]], I still needed to
revisit [[https://moxie.org/blog/the-worst/][The Worst]] by Moxie to get a grip on my spending. After an initial rush,
the left overs include a functional understanding of various components in a
fountain pen, ways of tweaking the mechanisms and a more balanced love for
beautiful inks[fn::I will put up some information about my explorations in my
wiki later.].

While I might have gone overboard, there are a lot of nice side effects. The
variety of experiences possible in fountain pen world are really enticing. All
those are making me work more on paper which has a calming effect on me. And I
am putting more value on words that go down.[fn::And my handwriting is improving
from the earlier shoddy crap.]

I /might/ still not really stop spending, but I am looking at these as equivalents
of things like a cozy sitting place which invite and assist you in doing a more
important task like reading a book.
