This is a short curation of things you can do in your visit to Varanasi. You
should compliment this with lists like [Tripadvisor's
here](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Tourism-g297685-Varanasi_Varanasi_District_Uttar_Pradesh-Vacations.html).

!!! WARNING
    The weather is cold during the start of December (throughout the day you
    might need a sweatshirt) and you should be prepared for that.

# Art and Culture

- [Premchand Memorial](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SuSsXkSiDix9ZDV39): Visit Lamhi
  village, the birthplace of Munshi Premchand, one of India's greatest
  writers. If you are staying in Siddhi Vinayak Inn, this is walkable from
  you. You can follow [this walk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9MgVKX8DFb1fduf1A).
- [Kabir Math](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vwg4j8Y5SGxouYMJA): Located in
  Kabirchaura, this is a serene place dedicated to the mystic poet-saint
  Kabir. There is another larger [_Math_ in
  Lahartara](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zGE8t1YhzTQuoWt17), but the one in
  Kabirchaura will interest you more if you are into his works.
- [Bharat Kala Bhavan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DEXf4Ekj52SFXz7d7): Museum in BHU
  showcasing ancient art, textiles, and manuscripts.
  
You will find birthplaces of many other poets, writers, and musicians but it
might not be possible to cover them well in a short stay.

# Ghats

There is a chain of ghats bordering Varanasi's South edge that meets river
Ganga. A few things you can try when you are near ghats:

1. Do boating. Usually people start from _Dashashwamedha ghat_ for this since
   that opens near the main Temple and also the road to it comes from the main
   market. But you can also start from _Assi ghat_, which is at one end of the
   chain of ghats.
2. Attend Ganga Aarti in the evening. We recommend attending this from boat
   since the ghat steps will be too crowded to stand in. Many ghats do aarti
   but, again, Dashashwamedha ghat hosts the main one.
3. Check out cremation ghats. _Manikarnika_ and _Harishchand_ ghats are ones
   where deads are cremated. Your boat guide will tell you when you are around
   them.
4. A few new ghats and parks have been opened recently outside the traditional
   chain. Specially check out [Namo
   ghat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CwEQosUdUz6zau5E7) and [Ravidas Smarak
   Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BFZLqHdamHFUh6a18)
   
# Sarnath

Sarnath is the place where Buddha gave his first sermon. This is now developed
in a large complex where you can find the famous _Dhameka Stupa_, many Buddhist
temples, museums, deer park, and more here. This is in the North part of the
city (close to our stay) and can take anywhere from 2 hours to the whole day to
cover, depending on you.

# Food

Definitely try the following:

- _Tamatar Chaat_ is a Varanasi speciality. If you are in ghat area, try getting
  these from [Kashi Chaat Bhandar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QyJeypx58hj2qZ8MA).
- _Chooda-Matar_. Kashi Chaat Bhandar serves this as well.
- _Baati Chokha_: Authentic Bhojpuri cuisine served in many places as street
  food. In case you want to eat this more comfortably in a restaurant like
  setting, try [Baati Chokha
  Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WdzCfFXQPtEdAhy1A).
- _Malaiyo_: Must try light foam-like sweet made from milk. You can find this in
  ghat market areas easily.
- _Thandai_: A signature drink at Godowlia and ghat areas. Be careful with
  Bhaang if you have not tried it before. Ask us if you are confused.
- _Banarasi Lassi_: There are many famous spots. Honestly you can try anywhere
  near the ghats but there are a few popular places like [Blue
  Lassi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x2ATWUs4GXZRMpwC9). If you are visiting
  Ramnagar fort on the other side of river, you should try Ramnagar Lassi too.
  
Other than these you can find Rabdi Jalebi, Kachori sabji, and other kinds of
chaats all in the local market around ghats.

# Places of Worship

There are many temples, mosques, and other places of worship in Varanasi so we
will just point a few interesting ones instead of the most popular ones which
you can get via a web search anyway:

1. [Sarnath Buddhist Temple](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SFHfgVM7BhLMuHrAA). There
   are many other temples from various buddhist subcultures in the Sarnath
   complex.
1. [Vishwanath Mandir, BHU
   Campus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TXeY7TU3hLnmcrBa6). If you can't deal with
   the crowd of Vishwanath Mandir on the ghats, you can go in BHU campus and
   check this, more spacious temple out.
2. [Bharat Mata Mandir](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VdTFfgyvLnLPoD84A)
3. [Swarved Mahamandir Dham](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JjqKSMAUEDANDZ4z6) is a
   recently opened temple and meditation center that's on the remote North East
   side of the city. You can visit this along with Sarnath since they are on the
   same side.

# Shopping & Other Places

- When you are in the ghat area, you will be in the main market for many
  Banarasi traditional art and crafts.
- Near various memorials of writers and poets, you can find their work and books
  that you can buy.
- Banaras Hindu University (BHU) has a big, beautiful, and green campus that you
  can explore.
- Across the river, there is Ramnagar fort which has small museum of royal
  history.
