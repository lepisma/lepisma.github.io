#+TODO: TOREAD READING | READ

Books to read. This is a rather large list with items from my old Goodreads
account. Most likely I will /not/ be reading all of these because this list grows
faster than I read.

/Sorting is based on date added (recent first)/ but might be off since I am trying
to categorize things in sections.

#+TOC: headlines 2

* Non Fiction
Some non fiction. Most of the books are still in uncategorized section.

** Mathematics/Logic
Books with more mathematical and logical inclinations. Some theoretical computer
science books might also go in here.

** Evolution/Emergence/Order
This is a slightly fuzzy section. What I have put here are books that try to or
assist in understanding why and how are there certain /order/ and /pattern/ in
nature. I am not sure which exact fields to look at for answers to questions
about natural order and its emergence, therefore this section might stay a
hodgepodge for a while.

This is about viewing evolution as computing a PAC learnable solution
(specifically a subset, the /evolvable/ class of functions).

An important general point throughout the book is about the separation between
/theoryless/ and /theoryful/ problems. In case of theoryless, the solver tries to
/cope/ under some specific data distribution using a computational and statistical
efficient (in the regular polynomial complexity term) algorithm. This formalism
shapes the focus of the book which is more about the practical tractability of
nature's algorithms rather than the algorithms themselves.

This is a great book. It's of perfect length for the matter and the way it
presents them.

At places, it felt like doing a little bit of exaggeration by criticizing the
classical wisdom too much. Many of the times an approach which has less
explanation and theory behind it is frowned upon. Many of the group-behavior
based solutions fall in this category. They might work well, but their lack of
popularity is not /entirely/ surprising and irrational.

Also, the last chapter on democracy worries me a little. The point of the
chapter is that democracy is better than other forms /because/ it uses the crowd's
wisdom. While presenting good arguments, this chapter tries to convince you of
something vague. Not that the conclusion is wrong---that group wisdom can be
used much more effectively in a democracy---but the examples leave places to
fill in before you get completely satisfied.

Overall, I like how the book classifies the type of problems faced by a crowd
and the conditions they need to make wise decisions there. These are some really
good cues for analyzing and understanding a bunch of social scenarios.

This is about /team/ software engineering which makes it a book on management more
than anything. A few essays (e.g. /No Silver Bullet/) and many ideas are pretty
famous so might not give a POV shift.

I liked the piece on consistency which discussed why single designer systems
make practical sense.

Languages used in the book (FORTRAN, PL/I) are outdated but the ideas discussed
are pretty relevant, specially for /professional/ programmers (since
maintainability issues show up quickly when multiple people are involved).

The rules listed in the book, which you can read from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Programming_Style][Wikipedia page]], are
commonplace these days (at least in theory) but since the book is short and the
commentary elaborates a certain approach for application of these rules, it's a
worthwhile read.

Fifth the ET's series. This one felt a little incoherent and little less
thematic. But once you set up the right mood to read then it's enjoyable. I
found it to be a little less informative as compared to previous ones but that
might be an artifact of me reading the previous four more or less together so I
might not be the best judge of /information per book/.

I read this in a hardbound version and I came to know about the category of
coffee table books. That made me read it also like a coffee table book, in a
slower than usual pace with a little bit of jumping around through chapters.

:END:

This is the ideological sequel to /Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance/ and
has a more formalized explanation of 'Quality'. Even though I /might/ be writing a
short post about my feelings for Quality, I feel I can do some nitpicking here.

In the closing sections, there is an exploration of root of the word /arete/ where
we go on to find connections with the Sanskrit word ऋत. Then we connect a few
more dots and /conclude/ a few things. What worries me is the process of getting
there which felt like inducing a lot of bias. Maybe there is a connection, maybe
there is none. But if this connection is important, then we should be going
there in a more matter-of-fact fashion and a bit earlier too.

This nebulousness gets reinforced by a few other cases where the arguments don't
feel /very/ solid for something which maybe doesn't even need an objective
argument to begin with. For example there is a discussion of nimbus which tries
to convince you of dynamic quality in an empirical-ish way but then stays at a
kind of /safe distance/.

The book is read worthy but if you come in with questions, you probably will not
be a very comfortable person at the end. To clarify, a part of this is because
the idea itself is not /the/ theory of everything, but there are other pieces
(like the examples above) which will leave you feeling like you can find
inconsistencies somewhere. My next steps will mostly involve trying to do this
/finding/ and see what things pop up.

:END:

This reminds me a lot of a newer book 'Consciousness and the Social Brain' by
Michael Graziano, where the author talks about an /attention schema/. In that,
consciousness of a system is basically /attention/ directed towards a model of
itself.

And this is the idea behind the strange loops in /this/ book. A system with enough
representational power to represent /itself/ is going to perceive, analyze and
modify /itself/. This ability to loop around is what makes it conscious.

This book is good but unless you have dualist tendencies or have inclination
towards other solutions, it might feel lengthy since Douglas presents a lot of
examples and analogies.

I am unsure if I really get the philosophy of quality. The basic idea is
alright, Quality goes above the subject/object division and bridges them both.
As a way of life, it has certain nice outcomes. What I am not sure of, is about
the /objective/ (note the contradiction, which I can't avoid with my current
philosophical knowledge) truth of the thesis considering all the scientific
knowledge we have right now.

Knowing that the second book goes on formalizing this concept a little bit more,
I will hold my opinions for a while. Nevertheless, this is a nice read with a
beautiful story embedded in it.

Thanks to [[https://reichlab.io][Nick]] for the book!

I think I got more from the pieces on logotherapy and less from the main body
itself which is the opposite of what I was looking for. I thought I will get
some deeply emotional experience from the main memoir, but I stayed relatively
numb while reading those sections. Maybe because I have read many works of
fiction with torture in difficult situations as key elements. Will I recommend
reading this? Yes. I would have hesitated if this book was too long but that's
not the case.

*** READ The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
CLOSED: [2019-02-24 Sun 19:49]
:PROPERTIES:
:AUTHOR:    Thomas S. Kuhn
:ADDED:     <2014-12-18>

:END:

I started this a few years ago but wasn't really in the zone to continue. This
time though, it went pretty well. What you will find here is a certain
presentation and analysis of history of science which is not possible to find in
the course of what Kuhn calls /normal/ science. Output from normal science drives
a lot of the practical progress that we see in the world and this makes us feel
that scientific advancement proceeds in a cumulative fashion. At the very
fundamental level though, this is not a given. Scientific revolutions involve
perceptual switches between two /paradigms/ which are at odds concerning the
/meaning/ of fundamental ontological forms. Post revolution, the usual methods of
scientific communication (either textbooks or pop-science) will not, by design,
represent the crisis faithfully enough to have similar discussions as in the
period of revolution.

You can clearly see why the ideas presented have controversies around them. A
good set of criticisms and arguments against it can be found in the postscript
itself. One that stands out to me is the idea that the whole thing promotes
relativism in some form. Considering the ways in which a certain person
assimilates a certain paradigm as true, this discussion is fundamentally about
whether there is a neutral standpoint for viewing and understanding natural
phenomenon. Most fundamental pieces of the book are based on absence of such
neutral /observation/ language. What happens if such is not the case is going to
be interesting.

:END:

Cybertext explores literature beyond the traditional linear book format. At
first glance it might signify recent technological upgrades in the medium but
it's not only that.

I don't think I understand or agree with everything. For example Aarseth talks
about web publishing in a way where the intention of 'someone' still holds the
political upper hand whether the medium is paper or, an apparently liberated,
WWW. While this is true to some extent, I am not sure if we can ignore the
accessibility aspect completely.

Overall the book explores the relationship and meaning of the classical terms
'author' and 'reader' in different settings. The style is a little different
than I am used to but it's a nice read.

A bit on the academic side. It would have helped if I had better background
about the various /-ism/ words used but in any case this book provided a lot of
food for thought.

The core idea which is shared by almost all the sections/chapters is that
computationalism is just a scaled up version of rationality and it hasn't
really, at least yet, improved (the usual meaning, democracy, equality etc.) the
underlying political structure of our society contrary to how the whole system
is advertised. More than just being another technology though, computers come
very close to and almost satisfy the vision of a crude, mechanistic and
individualistic explanation of everything. The approximation errors this time,
as compared to other technological shifts, are badly misread and the
consequences are more severe.

Here is a thing about self help books. You might not agree with them completely
and/or they might not present solid backing for all they say, but they do help
by letting you think about ideas you could not have thought much about
otherwise.

This particular book is a neat example. I bet it is /like/ (in spite of the
presentation, which brought me to read it) other similar books in the genre.
That means it fits into my earlier paragraph's argument and I wouldn't /strongly/
recommend this specific book but would recommend reading/thinking about the
topics it touches.

There are two comments I would like to make here:

1. Probably we can tone down the /mad genius/ thing a little bit. I am, of course,
   not sure if the mad genius idea is true but I felt like it was implied very
   /literally/ here without being actually needed. From what I have perceived in
   life, the struggles of conflicting thoughts leading to insanity (or even
   occasional & innocuous fits) are indifferent to whether you are logician or
   not. You just need to spend enough time with yourself and it follows pretty
   directly.
2. Putting aside a few things, this is a deep book. I was thinking to just take
   a glance and ended up reading the whole thing in a sitting. Don't expect to
   learn much though. This is /not a book/ on logic. It's exactly what its title
   (or subtitle) says /An epic search for truth/.

I guess this one is supposed to be read like blog posts since a lot of the ideas
are not /very/ scientific. The basic thesis is that there is a set of evolutionary
adapted traits which are helpful if you are trying to cheat in a social species
and such traits are what make psychopaths. The question about the /degree of
coverage/ is something I am not very sure about.

A few general points which I feel are okay to take away:
1. Psychopaths have a limited set of /true/ emotions.
2. Their emotional (mimicking) costs are nil so they have a lot of manipulative
   power.
3. They are very practical and thus very different from the run of the mill
   psychopaths shown in popular media. The difference is important since this
   defines the type of attacks you can expect.
4. Counter attacks need well thought out plans since they will mostly beat you
   in unplanned arguments involving a third party's judgement.

Overall this is a pretty opinionated take on the topic. There are a few nice
ideas that can help you put things into perspective and understand similar
situations in a better way. I can't really say a lot since I don't know enough
to put proper refutations.

Strange Loop'. Lots of sections and subsections. A bit too many to keep things
coherent specially when you keep going off and on (though I am not sure which
way the causality goes here). Anyway, a lot of the major ideas from the book are
popularly known these days so it's hard to recommend as such. Though here is a
line somewhere from the ending that helps in looking at this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
...this book should be read less as a text of scientific scholarship and more as
an adventure story for the imagination.

Why am I reading this book? Recently both my reading quality and quantity have
gone down. I feel the depth I used to go through for any reading was more
before. There are many reasons for that and I don't want to go there in this
note. But one strong way of recovery is to do some structured reading. Similar
to how to write a thesis, this book seems like covering a certain way of reading
deeply. I don't know if the exact approach will work for me but I am hoping to
be able to build my own /better/ approach.

This is a /really/ heavy upgrade on the first book. The acts and inhibitions go
much deeper here. Going by my thoughts about the first book, this one /too/ is not
very /detailed/ from the perspective of the plot itself. But the point here is
more about the perplexity of prescience than anything else, and the book commits
to that.

I surely am interested in reading the rest of the series now.

So finally I got around to reading this. I was looking for a solid science
fiction and had high hopes with this one. Disappointed that this is not really
the science fiction I wanted.

Keeping the soft and hard sci-fi distinction in mind, I would still say that you
should not approach this as a sci-fi because not much changes (at least in book
one) even after replacing all of the /science/ things with simpler alternatives.
This book is more about the rise of a prophet and usual things like power
struggle. Science is /not/ fundamentally affecting any part of the story line.

It also has a tone of prophecy around everything. So much that you might just
not feel the /anticipation/ and can easily guess where everything is going,
resulting in bland experience. This might work out differently if you either
like /the chosen one/ theme or have not read similar ones recently.

Overall, it had a relatively simple story (for such length) with some nice
character development (Paul, /the prophet/). I don't have plans for going through
the whole series but will read the next book (/Dune Messiah/) since that is
darker.

PS: In case you also feel a lack of richness while reading, don't miss the
Appendices at the end. They help adding some depth to the story.

It could have been helped by a bit deeper storyline and 'theorics', considering
the number of pages (~1000). The kind of topics it touched, it could have been
perfect. But at time it felt bloated.

Mid way, I realized that I have actually seen the movie (Blade Runner) but this
book still kept on giving and giving. I specially enjoyed the way the mind of
Isidore was picked. It's really hard to reconcile with reality after your faith,
your everything, is taken away.

As a side note, I am interested to know more about the author's (Philip K. Dick;
this is my first book by him) philosophical and religious inclinations.

It was okay but I believe a lot of value was nostalgic. The revelations (or the
possibilities of them) felt a little just-for-the-sake instead of actually
contributing in the piece. I guess this is related to having few more books (at
least A Pitiless Rain).

I always wanted to read this book but never got around to it, and that increased
the expectations in some way. The version I read now was a graphics novel. So
mostly different in texts that do the world building, which I don't know how to
compare without reading the /text/ only version.

I found it to be simpler than what I had made it in my mind before reading. But
there were many powerful /scenes/—one of the most enjoyable things for me in
works of fiction—peppered along the story.

Thanks to Unnu for this book.

I took a lot of time here, like I did for /The Name of the Rose/. Not exactly sure
why but I believe the reason is different. Personally, the fastest reads have
been the ones with really interesting /story/ where you want to know what happens
next. The story here, while decent, wasn't that strong compared to the many good
/scenes/. An example is the section on Changez's death with Saladin back at home.

I believe there is a standard way of categorizing such kinds of reading
experiences that I am unaware of at the moment.

This was a really enjoyable read. When I started, I had a concern that I might
be able to come up with a different organizational structure given the same
starting state of few young kids on an island. And I was wondering whether that
would weaken the impact of what I might read in this book later on. But I was
blown apart. Starting from the split in the two groups, the progression /feels/ as
real as it can possibly get. Highly recommended if you are into dystopic
fiction.

Thanks to one of the most selfless person I know for recommending this.

I don't think I got it completely. The story flows in a confusing and lazy way
and I stopped at many places while reading this. I thought a bit about whats
different here which is making the whole thing boring. Is it the weird way
people converse? Is it the repelling suspense in the story which I don't feel
like unraveling by pushing myself a few pages ahead?

Somewhere around 60-70% I got the genius (at least one) behind the writing
style. The annoyance you feel from the way the story progresses is meant to be
there and it helps you connect with K and his contempt for the court and the
whole bureaucracy. I still haven't tried to interpret every symbolism in the
story (and there are many, now that I think of it), but I do get the general
point now. More Kafka's and some connected philosophical readings should help to
get it right.

It's beautiful how clearly this book makes you see the importance of written
texts with all the imaginative diversity. It's this /diversity/ which threatens
any power trying to control minds.

The pieces around torture deeply reminded me of 'A Clockwork Orange' and I find
it (elaboration of torture) really impactful in conveying the depth of ideas.
