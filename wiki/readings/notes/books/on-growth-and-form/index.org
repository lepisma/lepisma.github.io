#+TITLE: On Growth and Form

Notes from [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/460984.On_Growth_and_Form][On Growth and Form]]. This piece is /so/ enticing to read. Though I wish
there were translations for the many Latin, French quotes scattered liberally in
the book.

Here I have kept interesting observations, ideas and insights from the book
separated in chapters and sections. I am following [[https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0486671356/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1][this version]].

The /things/ which we see in the cell are less important than the /actions/ which we
recognise in the cell..

There is a nice description of the process of cell division here. Not sure about
the exactness of the understanding as per our current knowledge, but the way the
idea was conveyed using abstractions of forces is beautiful. A point to note is
that:

#+begin_quote
... it is not our purpose to /assert/ that some one particular mode of action is
at work, but merely to shew that there do exist physical forces, or
distributions of force, which are capable of producing the required result ...
#+end_quote

A piece that I find interesting is of /Hydrodynamic magnetism/ wherein particles
in a fluid which are oscillating or pulsating create attractive and repulsive
fields in the fluid similar to regular magnets. The general idea of /permeability/
applies here and particles are attracted or repelled depending on their
permeability with respect to the surrounding fluids.

I am not able to figure out the right sets of words to see what this phenomenon
is known as at the present.

* TODO The Forms of Cells

A nice way of looking at inorganic vs organic is mentioned here. Inorganic
growths mostly happen through depositions, resulting in planes (and thus edges).
Organic however, happens through imbibition, which makes things more roundish
because of surface tension and other structural causes which result in spherical
symmetries.

I like this line:

#+begin_quote
The principle of least action explains nothing, it tells us nothing of
causation, yet it illuminates a host of things. Like Maxwell's equations and
other such flashes of genius it clarifies our knowledge, adds weight to our
observations, brings order into our stock-in-trade of facts.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
... the world and all the parts thereof tend ever to pass from less to more
probable configurations; in which the physicist recognises the principle of
Clausius, ... with which the biologist must somehow reconcile the whole "theory
of evolution".
#+end_quote

Every time the second law comes in context of evolution, it's always presented
as a contradiction by stating /life is order/. The above line feels much better as
you focus on a more important concern with /probability of configurations/.

An interesting footnote:

#+begin_quote
... The nodoid was represented upside down in the first edition of this book, a
mistake into which others have fallen, including no less a person than Clerk
Maxwell, in his article "Capillarity" in the Encycl. Brit. 9th ed.
#+end_quote

[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Capillary_Action][Here]] is a web version of the article. See Figure 12.

#+begin_quote
In short, the naturalist admits no exception to the rule that "The fact that we
are able to classify organisms at all in accordance with the structural
characteristics which they present is due to the fact of their being related by
descent."
#+end_quote

This contrasts with the physicists' perspective:;

#+begin_quote
... regarding these "species" [referring to snowflakes] of his, the physicist
makes no assumptions: he records them /simpliciter/; he notes, as best he can, the
circumstances (such as temperature and humidity) under which each occurs, in the
hope of elucidating the conditions which determine their formation; but above
all, he does not introduce the element of time, and of succession, or discuss
their origin and affiliation as an /historical/ sequence of events.
