In this tree I will document my time management and related workflow.

If you have been following my blog or journal or log you might know about
numerous attempts at better time utilization. Most of them failed because of a
few reasons, also documented.

Recently I have been trying to be more aware of the issues and have come to the
conclusion that focusing on time and stuff is sorta back-pedalling. I thought a
little more about it and came with the following summary of the approach I am
trying to go with next:

#+begin_quote
Plan like a general, work like an artist.
#+end_quote

Of course the definitions of 'general' and 'artist' are the stereotypical one.

#+begin_quote
Work In Progress
#+end_quote
