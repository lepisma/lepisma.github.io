Following up from the last post on connecting [[pile:journal:2020/06/28/drawing-in-org/index.org][Krita to Org mode]], I cooked a
minor mode for Org called [[https://github.com/lepisma/org-krita][org-krita]]. Here is a screen recording:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class zoomTarget :data-closeclick true
#+CAPTION: Editing in Krita and on-save reload in Org mode.

It turns out =.kra= files are simple enough to extract the merged png without
invoking Krita itself and so the overall experience is much faster now. Future
releases will add support for /creating/ new sketch files from within Emacs.
