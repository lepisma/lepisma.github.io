I recently got back to a graphics tablet. A [[https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/one-by-wacom][One]] medium. While my earlier HUION
610 was more featureful, I love the simplicity of One.

Anyway, someone on /r/emacs recently showed a system for keeping images in Emacs
getting live update from a Mac sketching tool [fn::Not able to find that post.
Not even sure if that was on /r/emacs or /r/orgmode].

On linux my best sketching experience has been with [[https://krita.org/en/][Krita]]. I am trying to
connect Krita and Org mode together for note taking. Screen below shows the
current system.

At present I can keep images in Org files and switch to Krita for editing.
Updates happen on saves from Krita. The problem is that export from Krita cli is
slow since it boots up the program for each run. This could be avoided if I can
hack around the cli source code and set up a long running process. Or maybe just
see if I can get something out manually from the =.kra= files.
