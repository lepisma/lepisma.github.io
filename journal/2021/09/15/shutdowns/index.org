#+TITLE: Ritualistic Shutdowns
#+TAGS: personal, work

I tend to say, to whoever asks, that I cooked at home more /before/ the pandemic
than /during/ it. This is interesting[fn::I don't think it's that interesting or
unique /now/.] since it's the opposite of the usual pattern where people, being
locked down at home, cook more than before. The reason I cite is of ritualistic
/shutdowns/. Before the pandemic, I would /shutdown/ the laptop during the walk back
home and in those gaps I would get chance to do things that would be hard to do
with the laptop open. While this can be framed as a self control and
prioritization problem, we all need external help from time to time.

Looking at my calendar these days, I think I need to simulate such shutdowns
again. This was also pointed to me by a friend recently who does work in a
priority order and attempts to cut off after a planned time. Acknowledging the
inadequacy of working hours is healthy and makes you optimize your approach.
Even though this is not something really new, I want to note it down here so I
get sufficient momentum to impact my workflows.

These shutdowns are equivalent to change of environments. Changing environment
changes the rules that you can play with, and that helps. My attempt is to
define these environments, and a plan for forcing myself to move among them.
Here is my current list:

+ ~Work/Full~ On my desk with my main machine, available on IMs, calls, and
  virtual meetings.
+ ~Work/Reduced~ IM and calendar closed. Writing is the major portion of work
  here.
+ ~Work/Minimal~ Secondary machine, not on desk. Restricted agenda and browser
  access. Drawing and studying form the major section of work in this.
+ ~Personal/Full~ Main machine. Writing, programming, and other creative work
  setup.
+ ~Personal/Reduced~ Devices closed. Reading, pen and paper work, etc.
+ ~Personal/Misc~ Rest of my life.

I have been force switching in various environments in the last few weeks by
putting shutdown times of various kinds and it's turning out to be nice. The
feeling of loss of time to do a certain kind of work is clearly getting offset
by having value coming out from something else that I wasn't able to do earlier.
