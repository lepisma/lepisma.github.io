#+TITLE: Removing Reading Biases
#+TAGS: personal

I have noticed myself responding differently to same Slack requests depending on
the messenger. This heuristic to focus attention is not /wrong/, but it makes me
biased in an uncomfortable way. An idea I have considered is to patch the CSS
for Slack so that I don't see user names at all. But I found that to have more
disadvantages than advantages.

There are many similar cases where I have developed primitive reading biases
depending on the source of content, other people's opinions etc. And what I have
realized is that a lot of those can be trimmed off easily.

I have started reading Hacker News again and found the default settings in most
Android apps to be full of factors that could bias me. I used to look at the
source, number of comments, scores, etc. to decide which item to read and up to
what depth. I am experimenting with removing all these from the post listing
view as shown below.

As a result of this, I have slowed down, been reading deliberately, thinking
more and arguing with myself, rather than trying to find a summary or pre-formed
views. Earlier I would probably rush through 15 articles in one sitting. Now
it's just 1 or 2. But the reading is rewarding. It's deeper, I start from the
title, try to understand what I should be getting out, then go in, validate the
claims, and everything else that is part of a healthy reading practice.

Doing this has exposed the reading-depth continuum for every category of reading
I do. And there are /personal sweet spots/ in all. I believe I am a little closer
to the spot in one of the categories now.
