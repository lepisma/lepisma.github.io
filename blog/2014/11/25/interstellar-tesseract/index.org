#+TITLE: The Interstellar's Tesseract
#+TAGS: ramble

Just watched [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692][Interstellar]] and boy! It was beauty. From flawlessly getting away
with the paradoxes every sci fi movie (specially related to time travel) faces,
to the /[[http://www.wired.com/2014/10/astrophysics-interstellar-black-hole/][celebrated]]/ black hole visualisation, everything was a work of art.

I was just wondering if we can help the lower dimensional people (If there are
any) using a similar relay for our understandings of the worlds. But before
that, we need to understand how the tesseract worked in the movie.

First thing first, this Tesseract is not an infinity stone. Die Marvel! From
wikipedia,

  In geometry, the tesseract is the four-dimensional analog of the cube (4-cube
  hypercube); the tesseract is to the cube as the cube is to the square.

Pretty much sums it up. As you can project a cube on a two dimensional space to
get a square, similarly you can project a tesseract on 3. But the results aren't
very intuitive, see image below.

In the movie, the higher civilization (referred as 'they') made a tesseract for
Cooper to access time as a physical dimension so as to transfer the quantum data
from black hole to Murph via gravitational leaks.

A quick hit of instinct might make you fall for the traditional time loop as
seen in many sci fi movie. Time seems a locked dimension in normal space. But
see it this way, as seen from /outside/ the /time/, there is no relevance of past or
present or future. Its yet another dimension.

Counterintuitive, these might seem. But its nice, intuition isn't fun (nor is
helpful, talk /Quantum mech/ if you want a debate). What (hypothetically) if we
ourselves are on some higher dimension bandwagon and are treating someone's time
as our space ?

/"How would a lower (or higher) dimensional space be like? No, that's not
possible."/ If you were born on a gas giant, you would have asked /"How can life
be on terrestrial planets ?"/.

* Flatlanders
Maybe an organism (a disc) is in 2 dimensional space, moving ahead in
x-direction. A time space diagram for it will be

A really amazing piece of work by Edwin Abbott Abbott explains the life of two
dimensional beings in his famous [[http://www.amazon.com/Flatland-Romance-Dimensions-Thrift-Editions/dp/048627263X][Flatland]].
#+END_aside

The disc is pissed off with its life, (yes it has a developed mind to have a
sense of time and presence) and speculates about time travel. But here we are,
seeing this whole thing as a slant cylinder. It has no meaning for us, its just
there, disc's time is our space.

What if you want to share the /Interstellar/ experience with it ? You would make
the disc /see/ time as a physical dimension. You will make a hypercube for it. As
/they/ did.

The most important part in the movie was to recognise the importance of
gravitational leak across dimensions, the method of transfer that can be
understood by any /n-dimensional/ organism. You would grant access to the disc to
create gravitational anomalies in its 3 dimensions (2 space + 1 time), And an
/Interstellar/ event will happen in the flatland.

--------------

It all seems so immaterial to even have the need to /be/. Evolution is taking us
places, creating organisms more adept to their environments, but on a scale that
has no meaning (probably). I wonder, if one day, the unexplained gravitational
phenomenon in our universe might lead us to some realization. The singularity,
the dark forces, existence of multiverses, everything will be explainable after
we /really/ understand gravity.

In the movie, the (dumb) textbooks said that the Apollo mission was faked.
People always connect scientific advancements with the other side that has
personal benefits attached to them. Everyone goes mad when you spend a bit on an
exploration where there is, apparently, no immediate benefit.

But, humans are explorers, its inside all of us. Survival instinct, they say.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the
impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to
aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the
unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But
we lost all that. Or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still
pioneers. And we've barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments
cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us.
