#+TITLE: Resources

This page houses some programming related resources that I have found useful
while working on /anything/. It's starting out jumbled but will get more organized
as I put more things in here.

* LaTeX
While I haven't tried it yet, a modern solution if you write pure $\LaTeX$ and
not Org or something is probably [[https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/index.html][tectonic]].

* Tools
Few nifty tools. Along with the usual *nix pack, they make life so much easier
as a programmer.

- [[http://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] for document conversion. If you feel like something is off, check out
  [[http://pandoc.org/filters.html][filters]].
- [[https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php][imagemagick]] for image manipulation. A lot of image-fu is possible just by
  piping through this.
- [[https://github.com/kohler/gifsicle][gifsicle]] for working with gifs
- [[https://www.ffmpeg.org/][ffmpeg]] for media conversion.
- [[https://www.graphviz.org/][graphviz]] and [[http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/][ditaa]] for making graphs, flowcharts etc. Both go really nicely in
  org-babel.
- [[https://harelba.github.io/q/][q]] allows running SQL over CSVs.
- [[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/][jq]] for working with json strings in command line. Also see [[https://github.com/simeji/jid][jid]].
- +[[https://httpie.org/][HTTPie]] as HTTP client.+ Just use ~curl~. In Emacs, try [[https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el][restclient]] and [[https://github.com/alf/ob-restclient.el][ob-restclient]].
- [[https://github.com/ericchiang/pup][pup]] for working with html strings.
- [[https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/][youtube-dl]] for downloading media.
- [[https://aria2.github.io/][aria2]] for downloading the rest. There is an [[https://github.com/LdBeth/aria2.el/][interface]] for Emacs but I haven't used it.
- [[https://github.com/tapio/live-server][live-server]] for avoiding ~python -m SimpleHTTPServer~.
- [[https://ngrok.com][ngrok]] for quickly exposing localhost.
- [[https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli][pgcli]] / [[https://github.com/dbcli/mycli][mycli]] as db cli.
- [[https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr][tldr]] for quick docs.
- [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][rg]] / [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][ag]] for searching in code. Spacemacs has nice ag wrappers. 
- [[https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit][csvkit]] for csv-fu. Haven't used it but tools like ~csvcut~ are really nice.
- Command line tools from ~poppler-utils~ can help you with almost every pdf
  related task.
- [[https://github.com/clibs/entr][entr]] helps in rerunning commands based on file changes.
- [[https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr][SimpleScreenRecorder]] does most of the things I want. A few other fancier tools
  I tried don't work very nicely with tiling systems.
- I like [[https://github.com/tobimensch/termsql][termsql]] for working with tabular data in terminal. There might be
  better tools for particular use cases, but in general, just the possibility of
  using plain sql works nicely.
- [[https://www.ledger-cli.org/][ledger]] for accounting.
- [[https://diffoscope.org/][diffoscope]] helps in diffing much more than just files.
- Though I don't use it, [[http://taskjuggler.org][TaskJuggler]] looks like something that belongs here.
- [[https://www.gpsbabel.org/index.html][gpsbabel]] for working with GPS logs and related file formats. You might also
  like to use [[https://github.com/tumic0/GPXSee][GPXSee]] for visualizing tracks.
