#+TITLE: Values
#+OPTIONS: num:nil

There are moments when decisions you take define who you are. Most of these
decisions are hard and can't be taken without imposing biases. A few might be
able to do, but I can't without breaking myself.

Since it's hard to figure out the right biases /during/ the decisive moments, it's
helpful to list them down deliberately so these moments don't hurt your sense of
self in retrospect. These biases are /personal values/ for me.

Here is my list of personal values:

+ Forgiveness
+ Courage
+ Freedom
+ Excellence
+ Self-Care
