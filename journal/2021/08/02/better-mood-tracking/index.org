#+TITLE: Better Mood Tracking
#+TAGS: personal

Last year I wrote about my mood tracking technique [[pile:journal:2020/12/27/mood-tracking][here]]. While I still have
similar approach of logging, over months I made a better visualizer for the
entries. It's called ~mento~ and is [[https://github.com/lepisma/mento][here]]. Pulling the screenshots from repository
here:

#+HTML: <br>

#+CAPTION: Mood plot. This shows mean mood for a day. The
#+CAPTION: calendar allows navigating through the journal on
#+CAPTION: the right pane.
#+ATTR_HTML: :class zoomTarget :data-closeclick true
[[file:./screens/mood-plot.png]]

#+HTML: <br>

#+CAPTION: Mood scores plotted on 24 hours wheel. This is a
#+CAPTION: new feature and I am not very sure if it's helpful.
#+CAPTION: But I think few other trackers (non mood) might
#+CAPTION: show something more.
#+ATTR_HTML: :class zoomTarget :data-closeclick true

#+HTML: <br>

#+CAPTION: Total entry counts
#+ATTR_HTML: :class zoomTarget :data-closeclick true

I might not try to generalize the approach of logging and visualization, but I
am interested in building a correlation finding mechanism in ~mento~. My entries
have a lot of variables and trackers that could have interesting relations.
