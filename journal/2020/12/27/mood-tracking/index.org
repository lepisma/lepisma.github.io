Since September 12th, 2020, I started keeping mood logs. The entries are spread
across various files for quick accessibility. Here is an example from my phone
log:

I started tracking mood to better understand connections of various events with
my internal states. The hope is to manage a few of those internal states better.
I have been doing a lot more than mood tracking but I find this to be the
simplest habit to build and a good way to move towards fancier interventions.
Whenever I feel something is happening, I make a note of the event along with a
mood tag that lies in ={-2, -1, 0, +1, +2}=. {{{color-bg(#dddddd, 0 means
neutral)}}} . {{{color-bg(#9ad3bc, +1 maps to being happy)}}}.
{{{color-both(white, #16a596, +2 is a state where I can't be happier\, these are
special moments that I keep in my memory)}}}. On the negative side,
{{{color-bg(#ffa62b, -1 maps to states that I can recover from after taking some
time)}}}. {{{color-both(white, #ec5858, -2 maps to terrible meltdowns\, either
based on externalities or internal aberrations.)}}}

Since my way of tracking mood is event based, I have days where there are no
entries, and days where there are many entries. Aggregation becomes a problem
but I believe a small multiple based on min, mean, and max works. Below is one
such view:

After tracking for a month or so, I went to a feeling wheel and tried getting
more granular view. Here is the tree mapped to mood score colors from the plot
without coloring the neutral items:

-----

A few observations:
+ The =0= and =+1= feelings interfere constructively to get to =+2=
+ I am clumping a lot of items under =0=. This needs to change in some form since
  I don't think the current score definition will be consistent for long term.
+ Feelings don't represent all of what is tracked in mood score. Or they don't
  help to completely understand the score trends. There is a lot of context
  missing.

I feel mood tracking has not been helping me in a direct way but it definitely
is impacting things indirectly. If you want a hackable solution for yourself,
start with [[https://nomie.app/][nomie]]. Its data format is simple to parse and allows building custom
workflows and tools very easily.
