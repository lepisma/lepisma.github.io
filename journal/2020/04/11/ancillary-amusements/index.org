#+TITLE: Ancillary Amusements
#+TAGS: personal, philosophy

Originally dated 15th March, 2020, I had this entry lying around without any
substantial progress. In fact it was empty. By /ancillary/ I mean amusements which
you can understand and appreciate but which don't drive your actions in the
main. I am not sure what I wanted to write or think about here but I believe it
was an attempt to understand /which/ values we consider ancillary and /when/ they
overcome the primaries.

Recently I saw [[https://aeon.co/videos/how-the-philosophical-paradox-of-aspiration-is-resolved-by-a-new-theory-of-self-creation][a piece]] on aspiration by Agnes Callard. Ideas from there provide
a more structured way of thinking about this topic now. The theme of my thoughts
is now switched to the /hows,/ involving the process of shift of priorities, a lot
of which involve deliberate (at times accidental) aspirations.
