#+TITLE: Analogies

This weekend I finished [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1280983.True_Names][True Names]]. The core of its cyberspace lies in the
following act:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
making data perceivable analogically
#+END_QUOTE

This line and its materialization is /really/ insightful, one of the qualities
that make the book not go stale after all that has changed in the real world of
technology since then (1981).

Although /explicit analogy/ based models have practical problems, they provide a
good general framework for making sense of novel perceptions. In fact, most of
the changes in the way we think about learning has involved a few ideas becoming
/implicit/ from /explicit/ in our models. Analogy being one of them. Coincidentally,
I am going through [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/326790][Society of Mind]] by Minsky from the same era (80s) which also
focuses a lot on memory and analogies. It's a little too expository but looks
nice in the main.
