* Experiments
An issue I found with my approach is that I am too reliant on org-agenda for the
'view' part of workflow and that makes me look at tasks in relatively flat
manner instead of organized view considering project heirarchies.

I will try changing this by using separate files or tags or something. For now
solving this by going to a separate file.
