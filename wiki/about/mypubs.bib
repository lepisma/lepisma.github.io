	abstract = {Spoken Language Understanding ({SLU}) systems parse speech into semantic structures like dialog acts and slots. This involves the use of an Automatic Speech Recognizer ({ASR}) to transcribe speech into multiple text alternatives (hypotheses). Transcription errors, ordinary in {ASRs}, impact downstream {SLU} performance negatively. Common approaches to mitigate such errors involve using richer information from the {ASR}, either in form of N-best hypotheses or word-lattices. We hypothesize that transformer models will learn better with a simpler utterance representation using the concatenation of the N-best {ASR} alternatives, where each alternative is separated by a special delimiter [{SEP}]. In our work, we test our hypothesis by using the concatenated N-best {ASR} alternatives as the input to the transformer encoder models, namely {BERT} and {XLM}-{RoBERTa}, and achieve equivalent performance to the prior state-of-the-art model on {DSTC}2 dataset. We also show that our approach significantly outperforms the prior state-of-the-art when subjected to the low data regime. Additionally, this methodology is accessible to users of third-party {ASR} {APIs} which do not provide word-lattice information.},

	abstract = {Influenza infects an estimated 9â€“35 million individuals each year in the United States and is a contributing cause for between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths annually. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza are common in temperate regions of the world, with highest incidence typically occurring in colder and drier months of the year. Real-time forecasts of influenza transmission can inform public health response to outbreaks. We present the results of a multiinstitution collaborative effort to standardize the collection and evaluation of forecasting models for influenza in the United States for the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 influenza seasons. For these seven seasons, we assembled weekly real-time forecasts of seven targets of public health interest from 22 different models. We compared forecast accuracy of each model relative to a historical baseline seasonal average. Across all regions of the United States, over half of the models showed consistently better performance than the historical baseline when forecasting incidence of influenza-like illness 1 wk, 2 wk, and 3 wk ahead of available data and when forecasting the timing and magnitude of the seasonal peak. In some regions, delays in data reporting were strongly and negatively associated with forecast accuracy. More timely reporting and an improved overall accessibility to novel and traditional data sources are needed to improve forecasting accuracy and its integration with real-time public health decision making.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00384},
	abstract = {This paper proposes an architecture for deep neural networks with hidden layer branches that learn targets of lower hierarchy than final layer targets. The branches provide a channel for enforcing useful information in hidden layer which helps in attaining better accuracy, both for the final layer and hidden layers. The shared layers modify their weights using the gradients of all cost functions higher than the branching layer. This model provides a flexible inference system with many levels of targets which is modular and can be used efficiently in situations requiring different levels of results according to complexity. This paper applies the idea to a text classification task on 20 Newsgroups data set with two level of hierarchical targets and a comparison is made with training without the use of hidden layer branches.},
