<p>
Asking myself whats important in the keyboard vs mouse debate. Is it really just
the matter of speed or is it more fundamentally connected to what these devices
represent? I believe its the cost of attention that matters.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<span class='dropcap'>I</span> recently switched to a tiling window manager and gave in some more estate to
<i>keyboarding</i>. Not many useful things happen if I click around in my desktop now
(unless, of course, there is a browser window open).
</p>

<p>
Whenever I have to explain someone, who (usually) does not program, why I use
keyboard for doing things which are clearly possible using a few mouse clicks, I
find myself fishing around for some reasonable transformation of the same old
answer, 'using a keyboard is faster'. Do I really care about <i>speed</i>? I would be
lying if I said yes to that.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-speed-vs-effortlessness" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-speed-vs-effortlessness"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Speed vs Effortlessness</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-speed-vs-effortlessness">

<p>
There are obvious differences between tasks like writing text vs doing something
inherently visual which lets you choose either keyboard or mouse without any
doubt. The problem comes with thing like navigating through directory tree,
browsing web, reading pdfs etc. You know, questions like whether <i>h-j-k-l</i> is
faster than mousing or whether clicking on toolbar is efficient or pressing a
shortcut key.
</p>

<p>
Should you really use keyboard over mouse (or the other way) at these places?
Here is Xah Lee <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/mouse_vs_keyboard.html">talking about</a> talking about this issue, arguing that mouse
excels in efficiency at a few places and suggests a hybrid approach instead of
being a total keyboard warrior. Here is Jeff Atwood <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/revisiting-keyboard-vs-the-mouse-pt-1/">discussing</a> mouse vs keyboard
and "advocating a two-fisted computing" approach to improve speed. I mostly
agree with their conclusions that these two devices complement each other but
there is this little thing, this <i>focus on speed</i> that goes against what I find
more important. I am not really, <i>really</i> fast at typing. I can be if I spend some
time training myself. But I don't, because typing is now effortless for me.
However slow I might be to someone else, I don't even think about improving in
that domain (even though that is mostly a low hanging fruit for increasing my
overall speed). But I do play around with my other tooling to improve <i>something</i>
in my work. What is that <i>something</i>, if not input efficiency?
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Rice makes up a major portion of my diet. We have two ways to cook it where I
live right now. One is an automatic rice cooker. You put in rice + water and
forget it. It automatically gets turned off when done. It takes around 40
minutes. Another way is to use a pressure cooker. Put in rice + water, <i>be
attentive</i> for the whistle (so that you could turn the stove off at the correct
count) and get cooked rice in less than 10 minutes. We can do some other work in
both the cases, but the pressure cooker demands a piece from my bag of
attention. We almost never use the pressure cooker for rice (not since our auto
cooker broke though).
</p>

<p>
To clarify, I am not worried about shaving off microseconds but am more inclined
to reduce the <i>cognitive burden</i> while doing things which aren't the main focus of
the task I am trying to accomplish. I don't avoid something because its slow,
but because I don't like doing it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-interface">

<p>
Good design disappears. Its transparent and doesn't make you sweat for secondary
things. In application user interfaces, its the uniformity and familiarity which
removes the usage friction. Consider the minimize, maximize and close buttons
present in top right of many window managers. Except Mac OS (and few other
customized systems), where we get these on the left side, these make up a
universal language where you throw your mouse up there and things happen without
being overly conscious of the very act of moving the mouse.
</p>


<figure id="orgf3ac06c">
<img src="./dolphin.png" alt="dolphin.png" class="zoomTarget" data-closeclick="true">

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>A familiar interface of a file browser removes the mental effort of doing what you want to do</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Consider something more unorthodox than simply closing the window. How about
showing hidden files? Now the uniformity seems to break a little bit. You might
have to switch gears and look not on the directly visible controls, but under a
certain menu, which might be different in different file managers. This point
manifests itself more openly when you push this analogy further to much more a
liberal graphical interface, the web. The web is a wild place. There are near
infinite design patterns and more keep popping every day. Not that I hate it (I
absolutely adore the experimentation possibilities opened up by the web), but
this results in you taking more effort to <i>navigate</i> the web instead of focusing
on the actual work you want to do.
</p>

<p>
This breaking point in graphical interfaces becomes important for programmers
who are more involved in the act of <i>using a computer</i> than the regulars. They
are willing and able to customize their tools for avoiding actions they don't
like. The problem is, its hard to make <i>graphical</i> interfaces amenable to
extensive customization without making a mess. And if you don't try to do that,
you make the next lower level api less accessible psychologically. While using
<a href="https://userbase.kde.org/KWin">Kwin</a> (KDE's window manager), I was less aware
of (and willing to try) its scripting capabilities. <i>What behavior would I
possibly alter by scripting my window manager?</i> After switching to
<a href="https://stumpwm.github.io/">StumpWM</a>, I have done a lot of tweaking in how I
manage windows, just because now I am <i>closer</i> to the source of the tool itself
and thus have a much more elaborate mental model of whats going inside that
tool.
</p>

<p>
Do all these matter for the discussion in hand here? Yes. The mouse and the
keyboard are <i>just</i> input methods. They fuse <i>with</i> the interface to become
<i>part</i> of it. They neither stand for the interface you are facing, nor are they
complete representations of the vices and virtues of these interfaces. Being
just a part of the interfaces, the question now is about which interface, <i>as a
whole</i>, is better suited for users who can reduce the cognitive friction if
provided sufficiently deep access to the innards of the program.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-plain-text" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-plain-text"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Plain text</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-plain-text">

<p>
Take any piece of software apart and you will find code. Text. There is no other
<i>popular</i> intermediate representation. And text has a uniform UI. Set of lines
arranged in something akin to pages. Every piece of abstraction wraps around
this using a set of standards and opinions. If done well, the elements create a
very hackable system, which lets you cut off usage strain from most of the
places. And its easy to do well at text level because 1) text has a more
constrained semantics and 2) it provides a more accurate mental model of the
software.
</p>

<p>
The fact that plain text is <i>the most fundamental UI</i> has a lot to do with why I
skip mousing in many situations. This also underlies the subtle difference
between how and why an interface accepts keys. Is it for better <i>speed</i>? Or is
it for a more fundamental reason like <i>exposing its inner plain text</i> essence?
Here is an example. In Gmail's web interface, which I have used pretty often and
still do sometimes, I never got to use keyboard shortcuts because both the
keyboard <i>and</i> the mouse put me at the same level of control. This changed when
I switched to a desktop email client <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/KMail">Kmail</a>.
I went ahead and added some custom scripts/hooks and boom! I am using keys more.
Recently pushed it even further by switching to an Emacs based system
<a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html">mu4e</a> and its all keys now.
There lies my argument for saying that keyboarding is superior
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Its superior not because its faster, nor because there <b>are</b> shortcuts
for you to do things, but because you <b>can make</b> shortcuts to do
things.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And this has strong ties with the program itself. What I am proposing, is the
idea that keyboards symbolize the act of <i>creating</i> shortcuts rather than
<i>using</i> them.
</p>

<p>
Hint based browsing (like
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/mouseless-browsing/">mouseless
browsing</a> addon for firefox, see image below) comes to mind as another case
here. This lies on the side of an interface which <i>gives</i> you keyboard shortcuts
rather than let you <i>create</i> some (unless, of course, you are going to change
the addon's source code). Say whatever about efficiency, the interface these
hints conjure is at the same level as when you use a mouse. You still have to
consciously <i>see</i> where you want to <i>click</i> and then act accordingly.
</p>


<figure id="orgd9dc10b">
<img src="./hint.png" alt="hint.png" class="zoomTarget" data-closeclick="true">

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>In hint mode (as shown here), you can press the keys shown on links (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements) to <i>click</i> them. The image uses Hok plugin for <a href="https://github.com/mooz/keysnail/wiki/plugin">keysnail</a> in Firefox</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
What would be <i>the</i> keyboard centered interface that I might enjoy more here?
Probably something that lets me hit links by allowing me to <i>create</i> a filtering
function based on the context. This will take me closer to the page's internal
structure and will allow me to avoid effort. From the top of my mind, I will
make some filters for navigating search results in any search page (since not
all of them let you navigate with arrow keys). And this is possible because I
will have access to a more uniform view of the inner dynamics of any page.
Arguably, this is not the 'plain text interface' because the user facing side is
still the same, but it goes deeper than just setting shortcuts and embraces the
ideology of this depth.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Thinking like this, I find it disagreeable now when people talk about learning
keyboard shortcuts and/or improving speed. Consider Emacs. You will find tons of
tutorials which start by telling keyboard shortcuts. For me, while learning
Emacs, the turning point was not when I learned and <i>started</i> using a lot of
keybindings, but when I used <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/">helm</a> <code>M-x</code>
and came to know that all these functions (see image below) can be <i>created</i>,
<i>called</i> and <i>bound</i> to keys in whatever way you want.
</p>

<img src="./helm.png" alt="helm.png" class="zoomTarget" data-closeclick="true">

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Interfaces like helm combined with sensibly named items are good ways to explore what is possible in a system.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Keys are not inherently special, the plain text interface is. This also means
that at places without a plain text interface, mousing/pointing can be better
(like in browsing web). But <i>if</i> you have a keyboard respecting (in the sense
that it exposes its inner model instead of just <i>having</i> shortcuts) plain text
alternative, that is going to be smoother on mind because of the customization
potential created by the similarity of inner and outer representation. And its
this smoothness, rather than speed, which really clicks me.
