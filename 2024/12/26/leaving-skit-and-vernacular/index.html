<span class='dropcap'>N</span>ow that there is enough emotional distance from the event, I can write with
more clarity about the fact that I left my company <a href="https://skit.ai/">Skit.ai</a> around the middle of
this year. This post is a reflection on my decision to exit and some incomplete
thoughts on what I plan to do next.
</p>

<p>
While I will try to be respectful, I will not worry too much about censoring my
words or offending someone. That's not how I want to operate. If some parts of
this post doesn't seem right to you <a class="pile-link" href="/wiki/about/contact.html">contact me</a> and we can discuss them at

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-the-last-6-years">

<p>
I joined Vernacular (Skit's old name) in the middle of 2018. I had just
completed my <a class="pile-link" href="/wiki/about/education/index.html">Masters</a> then and was looking for what next to do. I had considered
pursuing studies further but wasn't able to commit to any specific area at that
moment. As far as work was concerned, the only constraint I had was to do
Machine Learning (ML) in a place that gives me a lot of freedom and agency. I
didn't know much about startups in general but I took a bet with Vernacular
which was started by my undergrad roommate (who continues as the CTO of the
company), and the leadership team was primarily my batch's (IIT Roorkee
2016). With a promise of freedom along with some interesting work involving NLP
and speech, I moved back to India and started living in Bengaluru.
</p>

<p>
I think of the next 6 years in three phases, each with roughly 2 years duration.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sec-the-last-6-years/2018-2020:-finding-my-feet">

<p>
When I joined the company, we were pivoting from building enterprise chatbots
(the kinds you see on websites) to call center voicebots. I was still an
academic at the core and had to spend a lot time just to learn working with
real-world users and customers. But during this phase, I also spent a lot of
energy on work so I was still able to produce quite a good amount of value for
the company.
</p>

<p>
Most of our focus went in shipping speech recognition systems in Indian
languages and, in parallel, going live with voicebots at scale serving real
callers, a feat that feels easy to do now, but needed a lot from the few young
and naive kids trying to build a product whose core and peripheral technologies
both were completely new to them.
</p>

<p>
This is the same phase where I started taking managerial responsibilities and we
made a more formal ML team where I did everything involved in an Engineer's,
Researcher's, and Team's life cycle. We built solid processes to hire ML
engineers and got some really great folks onboard. Almost everyone was extremely
passionate about their core skill set and a lot of novel ideas got implemented
quickly and provided immediate benefits. Overall I feel this phase had really
great grounding for building a stellar brand for our ML and Tech team, something
that was lost in the later years.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sec-the-last-6-years/2020-2022:-locked-down-in-my-head">

<p>
Unlike a few companies, COVID wasn't disastrous for us. Which is obvious if you
think about what we do, which is automating human labour. While working
remotely, we hired extensively and got a lot of things right. The company kept
scaling up well.
</p>

<p>
This was the phase where I did not do much tech work but learnt a lot about
people and, as a side effect, myself. Being in my home all day reduced the
environmental spontaneity to near zero. As a result, no thought went away on its
own, and needed proper escorting via thinking and reflection. Not that I usually
go out much anyway, but change of scene was a strong tool for managing
stickiness of thoughts which we didn't have in those years. This was both good
and bad for me.
</p>

<p>
On the good side, lockdown gave me a lot of time with myself allowing me to go
deep in any idea, as well as acted as an equalizer (all conversations happened
at reduced modalities) which helped me preserve confidence in my skills even
with a variety of people of all levels coming in at rapid pace.
</p>

<p>
I got a chance to think deeply about how I want to work, what it means to build
teams, how to interact with people. I also <i>played</i> with a lot with novel ideas
around leadership, management, ML, and technology in general.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-the-last-6-years/2022-2024:-disenchantment" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-the-last-6-years/2022-2024:-disenchantment"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> 2022-2024: Disenchantment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sec-the-last-6-years/2022-2024:-disenchantment">

<p>
After COVID, a lot changed. Not primarily because of direct effects like people
coming back and seeing each other in office for the first time, but because the
indirect effects around economy rendered some <i>value faultlines</i> to be more
visible than before. Additionally lockdown allowed me (and others) to explore my
values and philosophy of life more deeply and I was able to connect my inner
conflicts more cleanly with how things were happening, say, at work. So even
when a crisis of old gravity came in, you could see more visible differences in
reactions. With the benefit of hindsight, I believe this was a phase where we
should have done a lot of work to build cultural cohesion. This was also the
phase during which we had a layoff, which was&#x2014;in my opinion&#x2014;managed well but
learnings from the events that lead to it could've been handled better.
</p>

<p>
In any case, slowly a lot of passion towards <i>making</i> tech and product
diluted. Part of this was because we had to do more <i>scaling</i> than <i>building</i> at
this time. But this transition wasn't compensated well from other
dimensions. And when the time came to wear our <i>maker hat</i> again, (at least) I
wasn't able to find one in the locker.
</p>

<p>
While visibly different, the company was not in a bad state (financially, it was
bouncing back well and kept doing better than before) in this phase. But I had
been personally accumulating a sort of disenchantment that made me consider more
seriously my life outside of Skit.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Overall while a lot of what we did could have been done in lesser time, I am
happy about what we ended up doing. We were the first in market across many
dimensions. Some of our tech work is in our <a href="https://tech.skit.ai/">blog here</a>. A few open sourced
projects are <a href="https://github.com/skit-ai/">here on GitHub</a>. I have compiled our research publications in <a class="pile-link" href="/wiki/about/publications.html">my
wiki here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, as an early employee and someone interested in problems beyond
just technology, I was involved in a lot of things that no one else would touch,
including running initiatives across HR and marketing. I attempted many&#x2014;and
failed at many&#x2014;org wide transformations and setting up core processes and
standards. I also ran the initiative to rename the company from Vernacular to
<i>Skit</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Then there are things that I have regrets for. Not in the sense that they eat me
up everyday, but more like "If I had another chance, I will work on &#x2026;". A few
important ones are listed here:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Our core product is a voicebot that converses with callers to solve their
problem. But we are a B2B SaaS selling this software <i>to businesses</i> running
call centers, so <b>caller experience</b> becomes a secondary metric. This makes it
harder to optimize for but I believe we should have made more impact than
what we did. I wrote some of my views around this <a class="pile-link" href="/journal/2024/01/28/conversational-ai/index.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>I would like to improve my <b>decisiveness</b> in general. This, at times, led me to
not make significant progress in directions, technical and non-technical,
that I had un-validated positive hunches about.</li>
<li>I have historically not given much value to <b>marketing and PR</b>. This is okay at
a personal level, but at my position and in the competitive startup scene
this led to some disadvantages for our team and company. While I tried to
counter this bias, I could have done more and handled this smartly.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I am tempted to write a deeper retrospective but that probably should be done in
a separate post. For now, I will move on to the next question.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-why-did-i-leave?">

<p>
Leaving a company after spending ~6 years working as an early employee is a
complex event. People can talk about it however they want to, but there is no
way I could pin this decision down to a single event or day. When I joined
Vernacular, I gave myself 2 years tenure as a naive estimate since I really
wasn't very sure about whether I have finalized what I want to do in life. But I
got hooked in and it took around 5 years to have my first serious exit
discussion.
</p>

<p>
Here are some directions that, collectively, made me move out.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-why-did-i-leave?/misalignment-with-the-source-of-value-creation" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-why-did-i-leave?/misalignment-with-the-source-of-value-creation"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Misalignment with the source of Value Creation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sec-why-did-i-leave?/misalignment-with-the-source-of-value-creation">

<p>
Like any other company, there were a few business decisions that we took that
made me uncomfortable. But working in debt collections with an automation tech
(voicebots) was the hardest for me. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvjmm5/debt-collectors-want-to-use-ai-chatbots-to-hustle-people-for-money">Here is Vice's coverage</a> on us and this
domain in general if you want to understand the use case.
</p>

<p>
Beyond this specific decision I learnt that it's hard for a B2B SaaS to focus on
end-users (not our direct clients) which then mutes out a lot of passion for the
product since, while it interfaces with end-users, the evaluation framework is
held by clients.
</p>

<p>
I am not an idealist in this regard and I can't believe that businesses are
either black and white, with primarily capital seeking businesses being always
black. I believe there are different components that play <a class="pile-link" href="/journal/2024/12/17/roles-in-a-system/index.html">different roles in a
system</a>. But I also eventually realized that Skit's was not the role I wanted
to play. If I want to indeed work on Spoken Conversational AI, I would rather
work on user-sided tech<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> like spam deflection than something
that makes money for large companies at the cost (mental and monetary) of the
masses.

<p>
For all 6 years, I led the ML team and worked in a core leadership position.
Working this closely at top gives you a good view on how the company operates
and, importantly, <i>will operate in the future</i>. And this is a good opportunity to
figure out whether a team will work for you. In my case, I realized that the
leadership circle and their philosophy of working wouldn't gel with me for the
long term. Usually this is where conflicts in core values and principles come in
picture. For a young startup though, such conflicts could take time to show up
since everyone is growing and the true values are not what's written down in the
beginning, but what you see visible year on year, specially during crises.
</p>

<p>
I understand that details of such conflicts are very contextual and it's not
important to talk about them since they risk misunderstanding. But I believe
that acknowledging differences and conflicts as a reason of exit is a healthy
part of growing up so I do not want to hide this factor.

<p>
I found that spending my effort and time in abstract leadership roles was not
putting me in a state of <i>flow</i> day on day. I am primarily motivated by technical
innovation and problem solving and the opportunity to dive deep. More broadly I
believe that roles that allow me to create <i>things of beauty</i> using my skills are
what make me happy. It's not that heading the ML function at Skit didn't allow
this <i>at all</i>, but the added responsibilities as an early employee along with
being in an early stage startup kept me less free for such 'wants'.

<p>
Throughout my stay, I learnt more about startups and the reasons they
exist&#x2014;which is primarily to make money&#x2014;, but I stayed unmotivated by the
prospect of making huge amount of money. This made me more prone to
disconnection as the company took turns in the tides of market. While my peers
could anchor themselves on the future prospects and take compromises here and
there, I slowly realized that I was unable to do so.

But it would be a lie to say that I left only because of the above. I also left
because I wanted to move on and do some other things. I am a big believer that
<i>free time</i> is essential for truly novel outcomes, and I couldn't get any if I was
working in the same way as before. Among other things I wanted to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Study many topics at depth. The list includes intelligent systems, but also
languages, evolution of life, complex systems, and more.</li>
<li>Study philosophy and come out with something that I can call my own
'philosophy of life'. This has become increasingly important for me.</li>
<li>Figure out areas that fit in my way of life and produce impact that I could
be happier about.</li>
<li>Work on my body, mind, and cultivate other interests, including my tech
hobbies beyond programming.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Working on these with any form of seriousness needs time (working and leisure)
which I can't get in a regular full time employment. Adding to the fact that
having free time right now, when my brain is active, is immensely more helpful,
I decided to take a long <a class="pile-link" href="/journal/2022/06/27/breaks/index.html">break-for</a>.

The post title says that I am leaving <i>Skit</i>, as well as <i>Vernacular</i>. I believe
both were different companies. For me, Skit refers to a more ossified, late
stage startup, while Vernacular refers to a loosely directed hackathon group by
a few friends.  I am not leaving Skit-style companies because I want to go back
to Vernacular-style companies. In fact, I am not going to join any classical
'work' provider for some time.
</p>

<p>
I feel like taking time off from the 'working society' to reflect on life and
future is good and more people should get this privilege. Even taking a year off
for, say, spending time reading is hugely respectable in my books. I have been
out of employment for 5 months now and it's been great! There have been weeks of
busyness because of personal commitments but other days I have liked waking up
to no work, occasionally meeting and talking to people who are passionate about
technology and other topics in pure ways, reading and writing whatever I feel
interested in, and, if nothing, just having fun with computers.
</p>

<p>
I want to optimize for similar <i>freedom to play</i> as I move ahead<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>. Staying outside institutions for
some time is a conscious decision that can help me let go of some learnt but
meaningless behaviours and biases. I want to let myself sleep-in during days or
stay awake during nights and ignore anything related to <i>career</i>.
</p>

<p>
For a while I am going to prefer <i>art</i> over <i>engineering</i> projects. You would see me
working on playful prototypes more often as compared to polished products. As
far as sustenance goes, I have some options for ensuring income, but for now I
am going to save them in a stash and revisit them later in the next year. I am
in an active writing phase these days so you can always get to know what I am
working on by following <a class="pile-link" href="/wiki/feeds.html">my feeds here</a>.
</p>

<p>
In these last years at Skit I have developed most of my <i>adult form</i> and whatever
gives me a sense of identity. I also found many close friends, and lost a
few. Most importantly, I found my partner (we worked together at Skit briefly)
with whom I have gone through most of my recent life changes. None of these can
be done in ways that don't also leave some memories that are less than ideal. So
don't let the nature of this post deceive you from the fact that, all said and
done, I am really grateful for the time at Skit, and Vernacular.
