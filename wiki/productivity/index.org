#+TITLE: Productivity

If you have been following my blog or journal or log you might know about
numerous attempts at doing effective and efficient work. This document covers my
most recent processes.

#+BEGIN_aside
Many people frown on the idea of productivity hacking. I understand where they
are coming from. I have some thoughts on all that [[pile:journal:2019/10/25/hard-work/][here]].

I feel people should be free to experiment with their workflow to get the most
of life as long as they understand that same things might not work for others.
#+END_aside

After many experiments (still ongoing), I have realized that it's important to
define the core concepts to deconstruct /productivity/. I try to organize things
in /nouns/ and /verbs/ and they see which techniques help in what. My current
repertoire follows.

* Nouns
Items here are not organized in a mutually exclusive manner. I feel it's hard to
do that and so I am just going with whatever feels natural at the moment.

** Scopes
/Scopes/ are aspects of work. I tend to organize them in a two level heirarchy.
First specifies very broad /scope/ like ~work~ or ~personal~. Second goes deeper in
the directions of work.

** Targets
/Targets/ are checkpoints that define various goals for /scopes/. Many times they
come with a deadline. As an example, you might want to target a certain body
weight value by a certain date.

** Tasks
/Tasks/ lie under certain =scope= and usually have the following optional properties
attached to them:

+ Task /kind/. Programming, reviewing, reading, thinking, etc.
+ /Priority/. Important, not important, and all gradations in between.
+ /Effort/ and /appetite/. Efforts are estimate of time needed for task, appetite
  tells how much time I /want/ to spend on the task.
+ /Deadline/ and /scheduled/ date times.

** Rituals
/Rituals/ are habits, processes, and recurring events. The motivation for them can
come from /targets/ or from promises of pleasure in the act.

Reading an hour everyday is an example of a /ritual/.

** Events
/Events/ are calendar bound items, like meetings. Sometimes items not strictly on
calendar also get projected there and become /events/.

** Time
/Time/ is the currency you pay for execution.

The canonical unit here is number of hours but I like to think about different
/kinds/ of hours differently. Morning 1 hour slots during weekends are not the
same as the ones during weekdays. Same /task/ can have incredibly different
execution efficiency in these two slots.

** Notes
These are your unshaped ideas, reading notes, feedback, drafts, write-ups, and
everything else text-like.

** Interrupts
All external /interrupts/ like incoming emails, notifications, etc.

* Verbs
Here are my /verbs/, inspired by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done][GTD]]:

** Capture and Organize
/Capturing/ means saving items in your system. If the items are /tasks/, then your
list management tool's workflow will handle this. Good capture mechanisms cover
all properties of the captured items, are efficient, well integrated with other
verbs, and highly accessible.

Collection of items of all forms tend to move towards state of high entropy.
More so if the capture mechanism is clumsy. /Organizing/ comes to rescue here. It
refers to massaging your collections so that the next stage of /viewing/ becomes
efficient and effective.

** View and Work
/Viewing/ means bringing up items from collections to do something about them.
Effective /viewing/, for most part, involves smart usage of item properties and
good filtering mechanisms.

For /task/ like items, /working/ covers everything involved from picking to
executing them effectively.

** Reflections
/Reflections/ are periodic retrospectives. These are assisted by work logging
methods and helpful dashboards.

* Day to day method
Thoughts on a few common productivity methods. These are not all comparable but
are also not all compose-able. So, like with nouns, I have kept them in a flat
structure.

No single method works well for /all aspects/ of your life and you will need to
adapt a mixture of them for your own requirements. I have tried documenting my
personal mixture next.

-----

At the very top level, I maintain a /plans/ file that defines my time allocation
for various scopes. Allocation here is not strict and is mostly for helping me
strike a balance between scopes.

#+CAPTION: Current /plans/ file
#+ATTR_HTML: :class zoomTarget :data-closeclick true
[[file:./time-allocation.png]]

In the same file, I keep two more items:

1. Targets with date logs keeping current states. As mentioned earlier, not all
   scopes have targets.
2. Notes about various things to be done in /rituals/. Breaking the ritual is
   important specially when it's not just a /pleasure process/ but also involves
   learning of some sort. For example, 'programming your pet projects' could be
   fine as a ritual. But if you want to /improve/ programming, you might want to
   look at adding things that explicitly make you learn new concepts.

** Capturing and Organizing
For capturing and organizing tasks, I stick to [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]]. The setup is based on
Org Captures and can be found [[https://github.com/lepisma/rogue/blob/master/local/r-org/r-org.el][here]]. I also use [[http://www.orgzly.com][orgzly]] for capturing items on the
go. Here are my current capture templates:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (("p" "Personal task" entry (file ,(concat user-notes-dir "<>"))
      "* %?\nSCHEDULED: %^t\n%a" :empty-lines 1 :prepend t)
     ("w" "Work task" entry (file ,(concat user-notes-dir "<>"))
      "* %?\nSCHEDULED: %^t%^{effort}p\n%a" :empty-lines 1 :prepend t)
     ("l" "Weekly log" item (file+olp ,(concat user-notes-dir "<>") "Weekly review" "Done")
      "- %U %?" :empty-lines-after 1)
     ("t" "Team log" item (function org-team-visit-person-log)
      "- %U %?" :prepend t))
#+end_src

External events are captured on my work calendar. I do little bit of time
blocking and reminders for rituals also on the same calendar.

*** Notes
Capturing notes is a weak spot at the moment. I have [[https://github.com/lepisma/org-team/][something]] for logging team
notes and am looking to build something similar for book notes in [[https://github.com/lepisma/org-books][org-books]]. But
general note capturing is not that accessible or effective. My recent focus on
tasks have made older notes related files go stale. I might try looking at this
wiki itself for notes or might just give in to [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]].

I am also missing a way to capture smaller pieces like articles read or videos
watched. For heavier documents, I keep annotations in pdfs and in my [[pile:wiki:readings/notes/documents][documents]]
page but am trying to do something to merge with [[https://www.zotero.org/][Zotero]] since that's what our
teams are starting to use now.

One other form of capture is private journals where I keep notes on events and
track moods and other events. I wrote more about that [[pile:journal:2020/12/27/mood-tracking/][here]].

*** Interrupts
Interrupts for me are mostly emails and Slack messages. There are other places
like Github notifications but I go there only occasionally. I handle emails
using [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]]. While I try to keep inbox clear, I don't do it too aggressively
since I think mailboxes can be tamed easily with flexible systems like mu4e .
Additionally, unattended emails automatically get captured and show up in my Org
agenda so missing properties of email tasks like 'priorities' are also handled.

I have no good way for working with Slack interrupts other using slackbot
reminders and cleaning them periodically.

** Viewing and Working
On a daily basis, I open up my Org note files and revisit the dates keeping
weekly goals in mind.

Also I mark out one of the items that I want to do /really well/. This could
either be a thing that make me uncomfortable---and I am inherently slacking on
them---or things where I have potential to learn a lot more. Maybe these two
categories are the same but I like to think about them separately. Doing well on
this task makes me more satisfied from the day. Not surprisingly, this actually
helps me do more.

For tasks with set date time, reminders on [[http://www.orgzly.com/][orgzly]] help in bringing them to
front, along with calendar popups for captured events.

For managing time, I tend to use [[https://github.com/marcinkoziej/org-pomodoro][org-pomodoro]], [[https://github.com/adrcotfas/Goodtime][goodtime]], and [[https://github.com/dxknight/chronos][chronos]]. I use
timers only for setting restrictions on a few kinds of tasks. Everything else
flows unrestricted.

** Reflection
I use a GTD inspired reflection workflow. Key idea is to have layered goals and
a checklist of basic things to run through. Here is a sketch of what happens:

1. Capture everything that came up from last week.
2. Reflect and write reflection notes for items at each level, starting with
   weekly goals to /life/.
3. Write or modify plans going the other way, from life to weekly goals.
4. Set up dates for weekly tasks to be done in the week.

Earlier, I used to do an open weekly review [[pile:log:][here]]. Additionally, I used to track
time spent on tasks using [[https://github.com/rksm/clj-org-analyzer][org-analyzer]] but that was too strict for me.

For a few items, like for moods, I have built decent reviewing dashboards like
below but rest need more work.

#+BEGIN_aside
I have stopped digital mood tracking from some time. I like using analog daily
journal for this now.

* Resources
+ Here is a [[https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/][good guidebook]] that we use to onboard people on OKRs at work.
+ Todoist has good documents on many productivity methods [[https://todoist.com/productivity-methods][here]]. I haven't read
  all of them. A few things in this document might change after that reading.

I have gone through many of the common methods and have few thoughts written
next:

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeblocking][Time Blocking]]
Here you block you calendar with tasks. You /calendar/ becomes your capturing,
viewing, and working tool.

This is helpful for a lot of people, but doesn't work that well for me. I
usually like a lot of flexibility and time blocking doesn't allow that.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR][Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)]]
A famous high level goal setting method. Usually good for /teams/ since the /scope/
is restricted and /targets/ are important than /rituals/. Is good for organizing and
reviewing. It's important to know the high level aspect of this. OKRs don't work
well if you start shoving it down teams that are lower in the heirarchy.

I tried using OKRs for personal scope but I don't think they work well for
situations where targets aren't everything.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done][Getting Things Done (GTD)]]
GTD provides a really solid way to think about personal productivity and
planning. GTD covers almost every noun and verb.

Even though I can never go full GTD, I keep taking inspiration from this
workflow.

** [[https://bulletjournal.com/][Bullet Journal]]
Another framework that knits together most of the verbs and nouns. I haven't
really tried it but I believe it's not adding anything new to my current
workflow. Other than being completely analog, of course.

** Ivy Lee Method
A short term method of picking and /working/ on tasks. You write down few
important things to do every day and do them. There are many variations and
names for this. The one I like and currently use is defined in the section on
personal methods.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method][Eisenhower Matrix]]
Simple way of organizing tasks in important and urgent matrix. I find this too
simplistic for my purpose but this can work really well under restricted scopes.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_PDA][Hipster PDA]]
One of the analog ways of writing down things to do. I used to use this by
mixing bullet journal and Ivy Lee type restrictions on a daily basis.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten][Zettelkasten]]
Mostly for note capturing, organizing, and viewing. I tried this via [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]]
but didn't go further. Maybe because I still haven't figured out that I need to
improve my note taking workflow.

** Inbox Zero
Way to capture and organize interrupts. I don't have any strong views here since
I do a few things to automatically capture items from my inbox.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique][Pomodoro]]
A /working/ technique that helps you stay focused and healthier. I use this mostly
for appetite bound tasks where I don't want to spend more than a certain time.
