#+TITLE: Drawings in Emacs/Org
#+TAGS: org-mode, emacs

I recently got back to a graphics tablet. A [[https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/one-by-wacom][One]] medium. While my earlier HUION
610 was more featureful, I love the simplicity of One.

Anyway, someone on /r/emacs recently showed a system for keeping images in Emacs
getting live updates from a Mac sketching tool [fn::[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/hafn69/drawings_in_org_mode_with_ipad/][Here]] is the post. Thanks to
[[https://github.com/lepisma/org-krita/issues/11][Accacio]] for helping.]. I found that really useful since keeping images separate
from rest of the notes, in Org files, is just a useless exercise in bookkeeping.
On linux, my best sketching experience has been with [[https://krita.org/en/][Krita]] so I am trying to
connect it with Org mode for note taking. Screen below shows the current system.

At present I can keep images in Org files and switch to Krita for editing on a
function call, bound to mouse click. Updates happen on saves from Krita. The
problem is that export from Krita cli is slow since it boots up the program for
each run. This could be avoided if I can hack around the cli source code and set
up a long running process. Or maybe just see if I can get something out manually
from the =.kra= files.
