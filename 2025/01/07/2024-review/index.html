<p>
<span class='dropcap'>2</span>024 was a turbulent and difficult year for me. I went through a lot of changes
which resulted in me staying a little tense throughout the year and made me
constantly struggle to keep any kind of rhythm.
</p>

<p>
Like the year before, I had a rough plan for this year which I can look back
to. The plan was vague in the beginning but got clearer as time went by. This is
natural as I want to plan in ways that allow room for a lot of changes as the
year goes by. This post is my year end review with respect to the said plan.

<p>
At my workplace (Skit.ai) I primarily led shipping LLM based voicebots to our
customers earlier in the year. On the sidelines, we built an <a class="pile-link" href="/2024/05/09/speech-llms-for-conversations/index.html">experimental
multi-modal LLM</a>. An important discussion that happened was around the <i>moat</i> of
our product since the Conversational AI stack was getting democratized at a fast
pace. This discussion around product differentiation went to a conclusion which,
I believe, is the right way to go forward. But around mid of the year <a class="pile-link" href="/2024/12/26/leaving-skit-and-vernacular/index.html">I left my
job</a>, so I can't comment more on this.
</p>

<p>
After leaving my work, I mostly did small personal projects in an attempt to get
back my tech fluency. I worked on <a class="pile-link" href="/2024/07/17/how-good-are-general-asr-apis-for-indian-english/index.html">a few</a> <a class="pile-link" href="/2024/08/01/hierarchical-event-bus-for-spoken-conversational-systems/index.html">ideas</a> <a href="https://github.com/lepisma/evdm">around conversations</a> that were
active in my mind but then quickly lost interest, probably because of some
mental fatigue around this field.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Since I had time, I spent (wasted) some of it on redoing my <a href="https://github.com/lepisma/rogue">Emacs config</a> and
theme from scratch. This further led me to an Emacs Lisp rabbit hole where I
picked up some of my old ideas. One of them was around <a class="pile-link" href="/2024/09/12/emacs-dictation-mode/index.html">dictation</a> which came up
on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41528919">HN frontpage</a> and led me to a few threads of work around it. Additionally,
based on some work on my note-taking workflow in Emacs, I ended up giving a <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/links/">talk
in EmacsConf</a> which led me to play around with <a href="https://github.com/lepisma/onnx.el">a bit of C</a> later. In turn, working
with C revived my interest in Rust, which is something I am carrying forward.
</p>

<p>
Other than Emacs, another time-sinkhole was <i>self-hosting</i>. After solving my needs
via <a class="pile-link" href="/journal/2024/07/20/self-hosting/index.html">self-hosted apps</a> on DigitalOcean, I got an N100 based mini-PC where I moved
all of my data and applications. I am still setting up backups and might write a
post later once things are stabilized.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to experiment with a few ideas in my <a href="https://github.com/lepisma/pile-android">app for note taking</a> since I
believe the state of text editing interfaces on phone is dismal. But I was not
able to do much around that. Now since the app also needs some refresh, and I
have time to study Kotlin more, I will start work on this again. None of the
hardware related ideas saw light of day. I specifically was planning to work on
an alternative energy setup (mostly pedalling based) to power my workstation,
and to make my pi-zero <i>writerdeck</i> usable.
</p>

<p>
A few more things that I worked on can be seen on my <a class="pile-link" href="/index.html">blog</a> and <a class="pile-link" href="/journal//index.html">journal</a>.

<p>
One of the signs of being stuck at work was that I did not need to learn
something truly challenging. So after leaving, I started getting back to some
philosophy, a few ideas in linguistics, and some evolutionary biology. Although
none of the <i>studies</i> were deep enough, they have set me up for further work.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, I had a decent year of <a class="pile-link" href="/journal/2024/12/30/books-read-in-2024/index.html">reading</a> and <a class="pile-link" href="/journal/2024/12/31/closing-100-days-to-offload/index.html">writing</a>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-a-few-hobbies">

<p>
I made some non-trivial progress towards a few of my hobbies this year.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, I cooked a lot&#x2013;mostly Indian cuisine. I made things that I earlier
thought to be super complex and learnt a lot by making variations of the base
recipes. I want to experiment more since I find cooking to be populated with a
lot of <i>follow-these-exact-instructions</i> tropes that I absolutely detest. A lot of
knowledge in this field has been either <i>non-scientific</i> or <i>non-scientifically
acquired</i>.
</p>

<aside id="orgd286f9e">
<p>
With a friend I tried running a <i>Cooking Club</i>, where the plan was to meet at one
kitchen at a given time, order your ingredients beforehand, and cook something
based on a theme. Then we all eat and, of course, have conversation around and
about the cooking.
</p>

<p>
We ran just one session though. This was at midnight, to make whatever we can
interpret as midnight snack. I want to revive the club this year.
</p>
</aside>

<p>
I used to do art (mostly sketching) when I was younger. This year, for around a
month, I tried following <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/">/r/SketchDaily</a> and it was very meditative. My main
motivation was to learn watercolor and I had a lot of fun while doing so. I
spent around 30-60 minutes per day for around a month.
</p>

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Some of what I made during the month of sketching and painting</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
I also somehow ended up spending a healthy amount of time on fountain
pens. Earlier in the year I bought a restored Waterman Ideal No. 52 from
<a href="https://fountainpenhospital.com/">Fountain Pen Hospital</a>. Later this year I attended a pen show in Bengaluru and
got a handmade pen from <a href="https://rangapens.com/">Ranga Pens</a>. After that I found a book that told more
about the history of pen manufacturing industry in India, which led me to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepenco_india/?hl=en">The
Pen Co</a> in my hometown of Varanasi. In a nearby town of Kanpur, I found <a href="https://kanpurwriters.com/">Kanwrite</a>
making interesting nibs, of which a got a few. I also <a class="pile-link" href="/journal/2024/09/09/fixing-lamy-2k/index.html">fixed</a> one of my regular
use pens, <a class="pile-link" href="/journal/2024/06/16/swatching-all-inks/index.html">swatched my inks</a>, and spent time journaling and sketching with more of
my pens.

<p>
I moved house around October. That took a <i>lot</i> of energy and halted some
documentation-dependent work since my address proof was in limbo for a
while. With this move, I also had to leave my old area where I have been staying
for the past 5 years.
</p>

<p>
Work was pretty dry. Primarily because of discussions around <a class="pile-link" href="/2024/12/26/leaving-skit-and-vernacular/index.html">my exit</a>. A few
months before and few months after that were just messy. Additionally, I went
through a mini identity crisis since it took some time to develop my sense of
worth without a formal role and some serious responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
One nice thing after leaving my job was me finding a sweet spot for meeting
people. I have looked at words like 'networking' extremely cynically, but when I
had no constraints and incentives, I enjoyed occasional meetings with friends
and interesting people around me, either individually or in meetups and
events. I occasionally started showing up at <a href="https://captnemo.in/cowork/">Nemo's cowork</a> and that's been a
pretty good anchoring point too.
</p>

<p>
Like the previous year, I travelled well in 2024. A bunch of friends got wed so
I attended a few weddings. My sister got wed too, that kept me busy at the tail
end of the year. While at Skit, I travelled to NYC, Vegas, and Valley earlier in
the year. I also went to Kochi again and did a short horse riding lesson in
Coonoor which was really memorable.
</p>

<p>
Very similar to last year, I wasn't able to make any progress towards learning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada">Kannada</a>. Though unlike last year, I made a few hits towards learning to
drive. With my partner I registered in a driving school and started taking a few
lessons and am continuing to do so.
</p>

<p>
Just after leaving, I planned to do some tech activism work. But that energy got
lost. The only <i>for-cause</i> thing I did was maybe a few donations but nothing
substantial. I also didn't think much about my professional future. Although I
was planning to come to that problem in 2025 anyway.
</p>

<p>
I have more free time now and am getting more clarity with every passing day on
directions I want to work in. As I am letting spontaneity seep in my life, my
plans document is becoming a loose directional document rather than a goal
document. I read this as a positive change since very strict planning has not
led me to interesting results. And I want to have an <i>interesting</i> next year.
