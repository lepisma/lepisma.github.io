<span class='dropcap'>I</span> have complete confidence that machines can generate content indistinguishable
from humans. This is coming after being in the field of Machine Learning for
quite some time, making systems that interact with humans while trying to pass
as other humans. No, I am not declaring victory (or defeat) of any sort. I am
just trying to say that any data that's <i>representable</i> digitally is going to be
machine replicable in time, and that's been true forever. Proving this is not
the point of this post. Here I want to focus on this <i>representability</i> aspect and
how that's orthogonal from what we mean when we say we want to see content by
humans on the Internet.
</p>

<br>

<img src="./review.png" alt="review.png" class="zoomTarget" data-closeclick="true">

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Can you tell if this Google Maps review is generated or polished by an AI? It probably is. But do you care about this if you know about the state of pool by a human friend <i>you know in real life</i>?</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

<p>
On the most extreme side of machine's ability deniers, we see people invoking
some sort of innate and non-reproducible linguistic uniqueness that humans have
which will <i>always</i> lead to differences in what humans create and what machines
could. Then we come to weaker forms of this that go like "<i>While machines can
theoretically replicate humans, practically there will always be some
difference.</i>" This camp, at the moment, talks about things like how AI text is
devoid of soul and creativity and this and that. All of this without knowing
that most of the texts that we humans generate are devoid of soul and creativity
and this and that. Does that mean they are non-human? We can't use a
meticulously and beautifully crafted piece of text and say that's how a <i>general</i>
human generated piece of text looks like. If you can put this soul and
creativity in digital form, according to me, AI can also generate content with
soul and creativity. The question then is, can you represent a person's humanity
in any other form?

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-true-humanity-is-/unrepresentable/">

<p>
When I was working on customer care voicebots, one of the key problems that
occupied our minds in the ML team was representing and passing on fine-grained
details of the caller's voice to our models so they could return more value for
the business. This involved a lot of interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralanguage">paralinguistics</a> work and
usually generated interests in two camps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Hype echo-chambers involving non-technical leaders, VCs, advisors, etc.</li>
<li>Researchers who wanted to truly <i>understand</i> what goes inside human
communication.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The unaffected camp, say camp 3, was of the actual builders who understood the
core problem and kept focusing on solving them rather than asking for higher
accuracy in detecting caller emotions. While this is a common story for any
hyped-up technology, I want you to observe the difference between camp 2
and 3. If you are able to break free of dichotomies, you could see that their
beliefs, interests, motivations, and efforts are all orthogonal.
</p>

<p>
I believe when we ask for true humanity, it's&#x2014;by design&#x2014;asking for something
other than just higher fidelity representations. We keep hearing that this
<i>something else</i> is merely a matter of missing representation, specially covering
what's always beyond current capabilities. When we were building text chatbots,
the missing <i>human</i> was in the voice. When we started working with voice&#x2014;where
we used to get a choppy 8khz sampled signal along with some metadata on a
channel&#x2014;the missing <i>human</i> was outside this channel sitting in a room somewhere
dealing with emotions that we don't know of. Regardless of what we do with the
available channel, the <i>human</i> always lies outside of it. Even if you have
thoughts transferred directly in computer representable form, we would arguably
say that the true human is hidden coiled in the inner thoughts that our machine
didn't read from the brain scan<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
But, the whole point of human content creation process is to create something
that establishes a provenance to a unique claim of humanity. This claim can only
be verified by finding and involving the person claiming it. And that's beyond
representation, since you can't simulate a person completely without being the
person themselves. Humans are singleton sets.
</p>

<p>
As for the product we were working on, that didn't need us to figure out true
humanity to get going. And that brings me to my next point.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-true-humanity-is-/unrepresentable//you-don't-need-humans,-just-solutions-to-problems" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-true-humanity-is-/unrepresentable//you-don't-need-humans,-just-solutions-to-problems"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> You don't need Humans, just solutions to problems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sec-true-humanity-is-/unrepresentable//you-don't-need-humans,-just-solutions-to-problems">

<p>
For many situations involving representation of human generated content in some
form, you don't need the full human. You might not even need a human at all. And
where you do need full human, you can't do without knowing one. So if you <i>truly</i>
want to know how a massage chair feels to your mom, you have to make her sit on
that chair. Internet reviews by humans on platforms will never be a substitute
for this. If you just want to buy a decent massage chair in general, well, those
reviews will work. As will many other solutions.
</p>

<p>
There is obviously an intersection here since our current solution for
trustworthy buys is based on human reviews. But this change of perspective will
make you worry differently about an AI generated review instead of a human
written one. The problem is not so much that AIs are impersonating humans, but
that you are not getting trustworthy information to make buying decisions.

<p>
I have enjoyed listening to music that my friends have personally recommended,
and I have also enjoyed algorithmic suggestions. But I keep it clear in my mind
that an algorithmic friend persona will always be different than a human friend
here, even if they suggest the same songs to me. Exactly because when I ask a
human for songs, I also seek the <i>human</i> in some ways.
</p>

<p>
When you truly need human content, you will always look beyond the channel. If
you don't need it, the channels will be just fine. AI generated letters could be
totally okay unless you truly wanted someone to put the effort to write to
you. It's not about quality and definitely not about how nicely can an AI
replicate that person's handwriting.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-where-am-i-going-with-all-this?">

<p>
This post comes out as a rant so I will take some time to tie things up:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Digitally representable data implies digital replicability.</li>
<li>Humans are (and their humanity is) unrepresentable in the full, even with
embodied agents. There is no mysticism here, it follows by definition.</li>
<li>Most times, you just need higher quality content, and you should try figuring
out how to get it<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> without tying yourself to a
source.</li>
<li>When you really need human content, you have to seek out the actual humans
behind them. There is no way around it.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This whole epistemological fuss about whether a generated text is by an AI or
human will blow over as models get better. And we will end up with the real
question in this debate: Why do you want human content over AI? And the answer
will not involve capability, creativity, embodiment, or any higher power, but
simply a cultural affinity to true human provenance.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
I believe the work on identifying AI or human content will move towards a
dynamic equilibrium not unlike fraud detection. And very similar to fraud
detection, you will realize that the problem is not so much about AI or human
but right or wrong (even useful or useless). Large content platforms will
continue abusing AI. Mixed systems will continue in the chaos of wisdom-of-crowd
systems to build trust. Small niche groups will keep popping up and out of
existence with artisanal handcrafted produces. But we, poor lost souls, need to
understand what we are looking for when we say we like non-algorithmic, human,
content.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't matter if, say, I am a movie reviewer but an AI is doing million
times better than me and all my friends who used to watch me are now watching
the AI. In fact, if they choose the AI, they did not reject me (or humans in
general); they just selected higher quality content. If they were really
watching <i>me</i>, they will continue watching <i>me</i>. I mentioned this earlier but it's
worth repeating again: All of what we connect with <i>humans</i> is about individuals
as singletons. If another entity or AI is going through the exact same life
experience as me, down to the tiniest details, then that AI system <i>is me</i>.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
I know that it's a strong assumption to say that everyone who decides to choose
content thinks deeply about the source. I am also not acknowledging the control
large media systems have over our own interests and motivations. But that's a
part of <i>my</i> humanity. You can better this post in so many ways, but it will never
be <i>my post</i> written at this specific time and place. And if that's alright with
you, you didn't need to know <i>my view</i>, you needed a high quality view.
</p>

<p>
And I believe accepting that sometimes we want higher quality things that could
be from machines and lower quality things just because they are from humans, is
a remarkably human trait.
