Many of us who do calculus using computers know the alternatives we have for
differentiation.

The usual approach is to go for either of these

- Numerical
- Symbolic
- Automatic differentiation

Since, numerical methods (finite difference) are the most /thought after/ methods
when people think about computers and differentiation, we don't actually try
other stuff. Forget symbolic, forget finite difference (and don't even think
about automatic), we have a course on /Power System Analysis/, which is a bit
computational in nature and we use a more /traditional/ method.

* Hand calculus
The problem we have is to find solutions of non-linear equations (load-flow
equations) that give the values of voltages and power factors for a power
transmission system. Idea is to use Newton's method and move towards the
solution. Guess what, we find the Jacobian /by hand/ and then /program the
expressions/. Although this is perfectly fine, but this screws the whole idea of
using computers.

The situation is exactly as in the image below.

You are a dog, your brain is optimized to judge movements, still you will do the
calculations just because this is /the/ analytical way. This is the perfect /what
the hell !/ moment. This is how you /row a steamer/.

--------------

It's not about this particular subject, almost everywhere, our course syllabuses
are optimized for least efficient use of computers (if used anywhere).
Obviously, you can switch over to your weapon of choice, but a lot depends on
what the barrack relies on.

Consider AD (Automatic differentiation). You won't find a cooler method to do
gradient computation. If you use Python, there is already an excellent library
[[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ad][ad]]. And most of the people in machine learning community (extensive users of
gradient computation) already favor AD (see [[https://github.com/Theano/Theano][Theano]], [[https://github.com/HIPS/Kayak][kayak]] etc.) over the more
error prone Symbolic and finite diff methods.

I don't see such spirit for power use of computers in our academia. The
arguments people usually give here are:

  You need to learn the Mathematics first.
#+END_QUOTE

Ah, you are already assume teaching Calculus /in/ Mathematics was a waste of time.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  You will learn nothing if you use functions directly.
#+END_QUOTE

C'mon, you were going to teach us finite difference stuff, weren't you ? Or
wait, you did teach that, but that was erratic pen-paper stuff right? Computers
are not vanity stuff. They are not disconnected from Science. Hate it or love
it, Computation is not a projection of Mathematics on Computers, /it is
Mathematics/.
