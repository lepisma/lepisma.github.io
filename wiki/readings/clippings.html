Compatibility is an achievement of love; it shouldn’t be its precondition.

<p>
Ordinary life rewards a practical, unintrospective outlook.
</p>

<footer>﻿The Course of Love: A Novel (Alain de Botton)</footer>

<blockquote>
<p>
Repression, a degree of restraint, and a little dedication to self-editing
belong to love just as surely as a capacity for explicit confession.

<p>
To be wise is to recognize when wisdom will simply not be an option.

<blockquote>
<p>
It takes a superhuman wisdom to avoid the consoling conclusion that one has the
harder life.
</p>

<footer>﻿The Course of Love: A Novel (Alain de Botton)</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
From one perspective, it can seem pathetic to have to concoct fantasies rather
than to try to build a life in which daydreams can reliably become realities.
But fantasies are often the best thing we can make of our multiple and
contradictory wishes: they allow us to inhabit one reality without destroying
the other. Fantasizing spares those we care about from the full irresponsibility
and scary strangeness of our urges. It is, in its own way, an achievement, an
emblem of civilization—and an act of kindness.
</p>

<p>
One needs a degree of autonomy before being undressed by someone else can feel
like a treat.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Insecurity may even be a peculiar sign of well-being. It means we haven’t
allowed ourselves to take other people for granted, that we remain realistic
enough to see that things could genuinely turn out badly—and that we are
invested enough to care.
</p>

<footer>﻿The Course of Love: A Novel (Alain de Botton)</footer>

<blockquote>
<p>
The average home appliance comes with more detailed instructions than a baby,
society maintaining a touching belief that there is nothing much that one
generation can, in the end, reasonably tell another about life.
</p>

<footer>﻿The Course of Love: A Novel (Alain de Botton)</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Maturity means acknowledging that Romantic love might only constitute a narrow
and perhaps rather mean-minded aspect of emotional life, one principally focused
on a quest to find love rather than to give it, to be loved rather than to love.
</p>

it takes a certain strength to cry, the confidence that one will eventually be
able to staunch the tears. She doesn’t have the luxury of feeling just a little
sad. The danger is that she might fall apart and never know how to put the
pieces back together.

What makes people good communicators is, in essence, an ability not to be fazed
by the more problematic or offbeat aspects of their own characters.

<blockquote>
<p>
We should add: it is a privilege to be the recipient of a sulk; it means the
other person respects and trusts us enough to think we should understand their
unspoken hurt. It is one of the odder gifts of love.

“Oh, come on!” she says, raising her voice to be heard. “At least tell me what’s

how fear can sound.

<p>
Logotherapy deviates from psychoanalysis insofar as it considers man a being
whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning, rather than in the mere
gratification and satisfaction of drives and instincts, or in merely reconciling
the conflicting claims of id, ego and superego, or in the mere adaptation and
adjustment to society and environment.

Few people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of us are

This is academic humility: the knowledge that anyone can teach us something.
Perhaps this is because we are so clever that we succeed in having someone less
skilled than us teach us something; or because even someone who does not seem
very clever to us has some hidden skills; or also because someone who inspires
us may not inspire others. The reasons are many.

interest in a community in another country wherein followers will be safe from
