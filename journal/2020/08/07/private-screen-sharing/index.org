#+TITLE: Private Screen Sharing
#+TAGS: personal, programming

Doing remote work, I have realized that it's very easy to, accidentally, show
private content while sharing screen. Even being super aware of the sharing
context doesn't help. There are many solutions:

1. Restrict the scope of what you share. For example share only a tab of the
   browser or a single window.
2. Use workspaces in every tool that you use. This is an extension of above. The
   idea being to share full screen but limit the scope of work view using
   equivalents of /workspaces/ in your desktop, editor, browsers etc.
3. Actively hide private views.

For me, the first doesn't work all the time, specially when I am doing
programming and have to quickly switch between many windows, editor frames and
terminal. Second needs a lifestyle change. Third option is something I am trying
out [[https://github.com/lepisma/conceal][here in conceal]].

Strangely, browsers are much less programmable these days so it's tougher to go
with the 3rd approach in applications like Firefox. As far as windows themselves
are concerned, I feel I can figure out an overlay drawing approach for X11 and
make the window selection be exposed via [[https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm][stumpwm]] config.
