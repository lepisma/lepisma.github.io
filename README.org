Pages and notes for my website. Elisp source is in [[https://github.com/lepisma/pile][pile]], sass files are in
[[https://github.com/lepisma/pile-theme][pile-theme]]. The webpage is accessible [[https://lepisma.xyz][here]].

I am not longer maintaining notes in Git based version control here. Since I
have been working on multiple machines from multiple places---and have struggled
with git hygiene for writing prose---I am syncing notes to a dropbox style
storage and publishing in this repository's gh-pages branch. This might mean
that the Org files here are frozen in time around [2022-12-31 Sat].
