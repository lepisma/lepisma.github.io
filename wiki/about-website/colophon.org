I have used jekyll in the past to maintain my [[https://github.com/lepisma/lepisma.github.io][home page]]. It's been nice really,
but extending jekyll was painful. At times, working directly on the system is
easier than writing /plugins/. I do concede that the above purported /pain/ was more
because of my requirements instead of insufficiency of jekyll as a regular
/blogging system/. What I wanted to do with jekyll was to:

1. write posts in org
2. have a tree-ish file structure (mimicking my local files)
3. run code blocks inside the org files

I actually tried to work on all these three issues by writing little ruby
plugins and helper elisp scripts, but it was not really worth the time since, at
around the same time, I started looking into [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][org-publish]] which offers everything
and more.

The set of pages here mirror a small section of my messy org directory (I am
still figuring out how to work efficiently with my private files. Probably
something like [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain][org-brain]] might help). Other than the org files themselves (which
are [[https://github.com/lepisma/lepisma.github.io][here]]), there are three pieces that assist in publishing:

1. The [[https://github.com/lepisma/lepisma.github.io/blob/source/assets/export.setup][export setup file]] which attaches css/js scripts and provides the general
   export config.
2. [[https://github.com/lepisma/pile-theme][Theme]] for the pages. This is a slight variant of my old blog's theme. Since I
   use it at other places too (at least one), it's now in a separate repository.
3. [[https://github.com/lepisma/pile][Elisp package]] for working with and publishing everything.

There are a ton of places from which I have taken inspiration (both ideological
and programmatic). I might not recall all of them but here are some:

- [[https://caiorss.github.io/org-wiki/][org-wiki]] and [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain][org-brain]] packages.
- [[https://thibaultmarin.github.io/blog/posts/2016-11-13-Personal_website_in_org.html][Personal website]] and [[https://thibaultmarin.github.io/blog/posts/2017-08-15-Personal_wiki_in_org.html][wiki in org]] posts by [[https://github.com/thibaultmarin][thibaultmarin]] made me realize the
  capabilities of org-publish.
