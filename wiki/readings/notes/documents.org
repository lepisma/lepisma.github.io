This was a really nice read. I suspect it's not that /nice/ for insiders though.
Anyway, this presents a way to create /case/ (in social sciences, a group of
interconnected events specifying causalities of some sort) using a few tricks
from network science.

Something a little counter intuitive for me was this idea that only robust nets
(let's coin a better term) are important since they carry on and are the only
meaningful things when you look back. I don't know enough but probably there are
two ways of looking at something like a historical event.

1. /What actually happened/. I believe happenstances play roles here but shouldn't
   drive derivations of general rules of thumb.
2. /What happens/, taken out as a general, most probable (?), rule. The paper
   focuses on this piece by presenting ways of finding non chancy causes of
   events.

The problem is, I don't know which is more important to know about.

A very recent review on the subject with a bunch of experimental results. It
talks about three "major causes of evolvability":

1. Phenotype heterogeneity
2. Robustness
3. Adaptive landscapes

And

Whether they often evolve because they confer evolvability remains a

:AUTHOR:   Pigliucci, Massimo
:END:

Barring for the various definitions of evolvability, we look at evolvability as
some sort of hyperparametrically derived quantity. These hyperparameters define
the phylogenic space the search will continue on /in the future/, therefore there
are the usual two arguments for evolution of evolability in the selection
setting:

1. as a side effect
2. targeted (sliding towards teleology)

Since this is a survey/opinion, there are not much technicalities here.

:END:

Here we put up definitions for /robustness/ and /evolvability/ for sequences
(genotype) and structures (phenotype). The main conclusion says that these two
values are negatively correlated for genotype, but they support each other in
case of phenotype. There are a few quantitative results on the setting of RNA
sequences and the structures they form.

The question I am interested in is, how much can this be generalized to
arbitrary levels in arbitrary systems? The key property needed to get this
working is:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
...even though structure robustness increases modestly with structure frequency,
this increase is much smaller than the vast increase in the number of different
structures accessible found near a much larger neutral network.
#+END_QUOTE

which gives

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
...the populations with the highly robust phenotype are more diverse, and this
increased diversity is much greater than the decreased diversity around any one
sequence.

:END:

This one uses the /NK model/ to experiment with coevolution. The main idea is that
you can couple one NK landscape to another using a factor similar to K, called
C, which defines how much the other affects this guy. Sounds like a reasonable
model to represent the essence of coevolving species. An important hint that we
get is that if a metadynamics is present to /select/ the value of K, then that
moves it to an attractor state where changes in the system cause avalanches
resembling the sandpile model from cite:bak1988self.

  :YEAR: 1990

  :PAGES: 12--37
 :END:

The question here focuses on how to get rules capable of computation in CAs.
Specifically, we are looking at /environments/ which characterize rules that
allow:

1. Storage of information
2. Transmission
3. Interaction between the above two

Intuitively, as the rule's output entropy increases, we move from a very simple
output (more /storage/) to output with randomness (more /transmission/). In between
these two, lies the region with the right amount of signal and noise with very
large transients and this is where most of the interesting events take place.

An interesting idea involves the definition of $\lambda$ parameter (that helps in
categorizing the rules) which is basically a discrete probability distribution
for the range of mapping function.

 :END:

The edge of chaos idea is pretty popular and used to explain many phenomena. A
short article criticizing that is [[http://bactra.org/notebooks/edge-of-chaos.html][here]]. This is one of the papers that tried to
debunk (kind of) an experiment (cite:packard1988adaptation; this was in my
reading list for a long time) which claimed that evolving (in the GA sense) a CA
to solve computational problems gyrate it towards the edge of chaos.

It's pretty easy to see the issue since a solution to a /specific problem/ (they
took majority classification) is going to have a /specific \lambda/ and that's going to
be what that is, in spite of where the critical \lambda lies.

Other than that, this paper has some nice explanations and insights for the
results from GA. One neat trick that I haven't seen much (though I haven't seen
much) is of keeping the number of /elites/ high and changing the evaluation
function on each generation. This looks like a more practical way to use GAs in
evaluation over real data set. I also like the trick where you stop at a
variable number of generations to avoid getting a rule which gets the right
answer by alternating between 0s and 1s.

** READ Optimization by Self-Organized Criticality

  :PAGES: 2358
 :END:

I believe it is not /using/ SoC in the strict sense. The key is the generation of
test patterns. Using the sandpile model, we get a reasonable
exploration/exploitation trade offs. Also, two avalanches are less likely to
occur on overlapping patches (I am going by hunches on this so can be wrong) so
it also provides a more coordinate descent-ish behavior than the regular random
patch thing. Not sure if we can say that SoC is /specifically/ helping here.

There are two things. First is that this is better than the random approach
(consider /random patch/ since only that is fairly comparable). This probably
needs a lot more test cases or some theoretical justification.

Second is about the optimality of the sandpile approach. How about other non ~1/f~
distributions? I don't know which generating mechanisms can be employed to get
the test patterns but fishing around a bit tells me that this purity of
distribution is not that justified (consider for example the recent
cite:broido2018scale). The point being: if you fix an annealing schedule for
stimulated annealing based on some /natural/ observation, that doesn't:
1. create a parameter-less solver, and
2. justify the /natural/ observation to be the optimal

All said, I liked the thought of a random /object/ (?) generator which does better
than the regular approach in the general case. If there indeed is such a
generator, this could work as an off-the-shelf technique replacing uniform
random search.

that doing better than CLM (character LM) and WFST (I am assuming this is an

while working with audio. Though I wonder what were the reasons for not going
with spectrums[fn::Might have missed somewhere or there might be mentions in
prior works] if they are replacing log-mel input in regular speech recognizer.

I didn't get everything here mostly because of the split between AM and LM
phase. Will probably look over with more background. Overall, the idea is to
parallelize viterbi as you would think but keeping inter thread communication
very low by clumping /actions/ which are mostly independent given their thread's

idea now but looks like there is a lot more to see if I start looking into
individual references. A general thread along all these models was the use of a
certain alignment (grapheme to phoneme) algorithm to get what are called
/graphones/ and then train an ngrams-ish sequence model on them.

Got here from srilm's disfluency (DF) LM. The idea is to have a /cleanup/ model
which models out certain common DFs, specifically filled pauses, repetitions and
deletions. Although there was not much gain, an interesting conclusion comes
with filled pauses where the DF model actually increased perplexity. The
argument being a filled pause, in most of the cases, linguistically breaks the
sentence and so the context behind it is not so useful for what follows.

Since the paper is old and also hints at a bunch of improvements in DF modeling,
I guess there might be a more recent reference around.

General point to use a metric for task success (they use kappa over all possible
parse-ables in the situation) and separate metrics for dialog costs (things like
number of turns, number of repairs, etc.) and run regression from here to
predict CSAT like scores. Once this model is learnt, this is used later on
without relying on tagging CSAT. The regression weights also give insight in
what is impacting CSAT in what way.

Another key idea was to tag turns using a technique that makes it easy to
extract subdialogs which themselves are score-able on the same scales as above.
This makes it easy to know what is going wrong (e.g. which entity parsing
strategy is screwing up) and how to compare two strategies for the same goal.

The most reasonable explanation for this finding – combined with the unexpected
finding of greater messages to chatbots – seems to be not that people were
tentative in their communication with chatbots, but rather that they were
modeling their communication to match that of the chatbot’s, in the same way
that people adapt their language when conversing with children (Bloom,
Rocissano, & Hood, 1976; Hausendorf, 1992) or non-native speakers (Ferguson,
1975).
#+end_quote

We can and should do a similar analysis with voice conversations. Since ours are
goal oriented systems, we can define a different set of factors to compare. Few
examples:

+ Non-standard queries asked. Even if the goal is to book a table, with a bot,
  we might see less deviations from a script and more with humans.
+ General conversation metrics like words per utterance, intents per utterance,
  number of utterances, etc.
+ Voice conversation specific metrics like interjections, acknowledgements, etc.

This should be doable on deployments where we have human-human and human-bot
data.

I also feel doing this kind of analysis is a way of knowing current state our
systems. If we really are human-like, then there will be no difference (except
when we declare that "you are talking to an automated assistant"). This analysis
might give us better metrics and pathways for building more human like systems.

certain constraints.

This specific paper shows the formulation and creates a parser for English,

/Assuming the title clarifies the goal/, there are three basic components here:

1. A _parser_ which takes a sentence $S$, a set of categories $\Lambda$ and weights over
   features of the derivation (generated from parsing) $\theta$. This then generates
   logical forms ($L$) with certain probabilities.
2. Category _generator_ which takes $S$ and its expected logical form $L$ to
   generate the categories needed to parse it to that form.
3. An _estimator_ which, given the training set and a set of categories, updates
   $\theta$ to increase the score of the form getting parsed.

The interesting pieces are the representation of the logical form $L$ (using \lambda
calculus) and category generation and pruning. Although the generated categories
can be arbitrary, allowing for wrong grammars and such, I believe, it can be
made to work better in noisy settings if we generalize /parsing/ and (maybe) the
meaning of the structurally rigid categories like $S/NP$ using a few tricks.

The main products are optimal algorithms to do ER which minimize the number of
calls to the black box functions that actually perform the matching and merging.
To do this, we first formalize the ER problem using:

1. /Records/ and /features/ as the data structures
2. /Merging/ and /matching/ functions as the operations

Then we look for certain properties of a particular setting (mostly the effect
of merge and match functions). Based on whether a few of these are satisfied
(surprisingly trivial functions might not do what you expect of them), we can
reduce the number of calls to matching.

do sentence selection on /in-the-wild/ data to get sentences with low value of
$PP_{seed} / PP_{large}$. These sentences and the /rejected/ ones then give two more LMs
which can then be interpolated based on a validation set.

Exact steps aside, the idea (other than SLMs on grammar generated data) is to do
some sort of /sentence selection/ to augment the seed LM.

They take a regular classifier, pick out logits before softmax and try to
formulate an energy based model able to give $P(x, y)$ and $P(x)$. The
formulation itself is pretty simple with the energy function being $E(x) =
−LogSumExp_yf_\Theta(x)[y]$. Final loss sums cross entropy (for discriminative part)
and negative log likelhood of $P(x)$ approximated using SGLD. Check out the repo

Although the learning mechanism is a little fragile and needs work to be
generally stable, the results are neat.

This is a logical extension of cite:ratner2017snorkel. Instead of users writing
heuristics, we go one level farther and just provide primitives (semantically
meaningful feature chunks). There are three components:

1. Synthesizer that does heuristic creation based on certain labelled dataset.
2. A pruner that picks /good/ heuristics, based on certain definitions and
   constraints.
2. A verifier which closes the loop by deciding when to stop, what to feed to
   synthesizer etc.

While there are obvious upgrades in how we are doing everything, the general
architecture reminds me much of classical rule learning systems like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_classifier_system][LCS]].

to extract such pieces with reasonable common attacks.

Important is their metric, called /exposure/, which kind of defines how easy it is
to get a memorized piece of information out by playing around with the model

constructed. Since this is one of the initial works, the overall framework might
change a little.

Simple algorithmic examples are provided. It will be interesting to see attempts

The update equation here is a minibatched SGD's with a normal noise factor
$\eta$:

\[ \Delta\theta_{t} = \frac{\epsilon_{t}}{2}  \left(\nabla \log p (\theta_{t})  + \frac{N}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \nabla \log p (x_{ti} | \theta_{t}) \right) + \eta_{t} \]

Main results involve showing that, when the rate $\epsilon$ decays following
certain properties, the noise due to minibatch dominates in the initial phase
giving us normal SGD while the $\eta$ noise dominates in the later phase which
basically lets us sample from the posterior of $\theta$.

The question of when to say we are in the sampling phase (so that we can start
collecting samples, taking the SGD phase as burn-in) is also answered though I
am missing some statistical tooling at the moment to appreciate it.

This is probably in general applicable to all analogy based methods but here the
idea is also to apply /learnings/ from one problem/domain to others. Two key
components are involved here:

1. Apply a /generic problem solver/ (in the classical planning sense) to higher
   order problems like reducing a past solution to a new solution for another
   problem.
2. A learning system which helps in learning parameters for a memory table which
   indexes actions based on the effects they produce.

Like in many older papers a lot of deliberations from here too are probably now

Two are noteworthy:
1. A distance metric, /reachability/ in paper, goes to tell how different an
   instance is as compared to seen examples. This helps in task 2 vs 3.
2. Memorized feature infusion which comes into picture in task 1 vs 2. Here we
   put more weights for features from a memory which helps in reducing the bias
   towards regular classes with large number of training samples.

This is a attempt to have interpretable representation from a neural network
that can be used with planing systems. The abstract should tell you what
problems are getting solved. The keys ideas are the following:

1. First Order State Auto Encoder (FOSAE) where the latent space represents FOL
   predicates based on certain input objects and specified hyperparameters.
2. Extensive use of Gumbel-Softmax to impose unitary credit assignment.

I am not very sure how different this is from similar recent works since I
haven't followed them. But the main difference looks like focusing on discrete
representations and planning capabilities of PDDL-ish tools. Interpretability
comes as a side effect.

Since the predicates here are anonymous as of now, an interesting piece of
future work involves a bit of supervision to put /names/ on things.

approach towards types since programming in a dynamic language involves dropping
a lot of so called writer's 'intention' here and there which does not adhere to
the static type philosophy.

Not sure if this is one of the firsts (the first for functional languages
according to the paper), but these days there are many mainstream dynamic
languages adopting such soft typing systems in some form.

I find works like this, and other approximate query processing systems, pretty
interesting since their general structures are close to machine learning systems
with slightly different metrics to be optimized. This, of course, then provides
a lot of food for thought.

So, what BlinkDB does is pretty clear from the title. On the how side, they
basically create a bunch of samples (table subsets) based on criterion derived
from past queries. The 'key' for samples here are sets of columns involved in
the queries' ~WHERE~, ~HAVING~ etc. clauses. When asked a query with timing, error
requirements, a sample is picked (after some estimation on some data; this is
important, since they don't want to put much assumptions on the type of
workload) and query runs on that.

Since they are mostly for high scale use cases, these methods are not 'very'
visible unless you are into such things. Although, I believe, similar ideas (I
specially liked the Online Aggregation thing from 1997) can be put in more
commonplace, smaller, systems (or already are there).

This is a famous paper and I wanted to see what it focuses on. It's basically
about the following two properties and their effect on modularity in functional
programmings:

1. Higher order functions
2. Lazy evaluation

The examples are nice and make this is a good read for beginners. Though I
suspect there might be better, recent, articles on these topics now.

A bit dated but has nice nuggets of wisdom. I like simple pointers like "writing
is debugging" which provides a different perspective to the way a few trivial
things are done.

Thanks to [[https://github.com/jaydeepborkar][Jaydeep]] for pointing me to this.

Original paper on Conway's Law. The reasoning used is easy to understand and
feels trivial in hindsight but there are nice nuggets scattered in between, like
the following, which makes the reading worthwhile:

A manager knows that he will be vulnerable to the charge of mismanagement if he
misses his schedule without having applied all his resources.

The basic idea is the following:

#+begin_quote
The main fallacy in this kind of thinking is that reductionist hypothesis does
not by any means imply a "constructionist" one.
#+end_quote

We are trying to understand that reductionist view is not going to explain
everything and that fundamental laws at the lowest level are not going to be /the
fundamental/ ones for the higher level ("Psychology is not applied biology...").
A littl0e hierarchy is also presented using examples where our movements across
levels results in /broken symmetry/:

- Crystallinity
- Functional structures
- /Regular systems/ with information like DNA
- Ordering in the time dimension for information processing etc.

#+begin_quote
So it is not true, as a recent article would have it, that we each should
"cultivate out own valley, and not attempt to build roads over the mountain
ranges ... between the sciences." Rather, we should recognize that such roads,
while often the quickest shortcut to another part of our own science, are not
visible from the viewpoint of one science alone.

** READ Lisp, Jazz, Aikido--Three Expressions of a Single Essence

  :JOURNAL: arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.00485
  :YEAR: 2018
 :END:

Okay, this was up on /r/lisp, felt not that much effort to read so I gave it a
shot. There are three general aesthetic avenues that the author covers:

1. Conformation
2. Transgression
3. Unification

The general idea is about the similar interplay of these in all the 3 things
(Lisp, Jazz & Aikido) and how they end up being a source of pleasure and
enlightenment.

From whatever I have felt, /things/ that focus on an act itself (rather than
prioritizing the results) end up being like these (well, probably this is
obvious).

This paper is a quick read and is not overly philosophical. Maybe that's because
one of the focus is on tools that stay out of your way by staying /practical/ (you
can see this when the author talks about /Common Lisp/ specifically). Although I
must say that I know next to nothing about both /Jazz/ and /Aikido/ so might not
have really been able to connect all the pieces.
