#+TITLE: Gaps and Voids
#+SETUPFILE: ../../assets/export.setup

I want to understand various models for innovation. One way is to figure out
what I call /gaps and voids/. /Gaps/ are where we understand what an end-state looks
like. For example [[https://boomsupersonic.com/][speeding]] up air travel fills the gap of time taken to travel
on this planet. /Voids/ are unknowns where all we have is speculations on what the
world would look like[fn::This needs more thoughts.]. TODO

Here is an initial dump of sources so that I can understand this better

+ Washing Machine delay
+ Washing without water
+ Travel time
+ Life Span
+ Food
+ Battery capacity per volume/mass
+ Per night sleep duration
