#+TITLE: Cab Contemplation
#+TAGS: personal

During the initial months of 2019, our office went further away from my place
and I had to take longer cab rides. More than an hour on average, one way. I was
avoiding the thoughts (and involved work) of moving closer by coming up with
various ways to use the cab time. One of my favorites involved planning a topic
or idea before hitching and spending the hour on just plain contemplation,
producing what I thought I couldn't in an uncabbed day. This supported my
laziness by putting forward a reason for keeping the distance intact.

I finally moved and started living within 10 walking minutes. /Cab contemplation/
is now a negative phrase in my dictionary. It is to thinking what social media
is to expressing. More of a marketplace than a studio. Short bursts of
excitement, loud distractions and an eventual amnesia. The output? Claptrap and
clamour.

It's surprisingly easy to justify your naivety.
