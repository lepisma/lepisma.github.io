  <h1>Hard work is misunderstood</h1>
</div>

<p>
<span class='dropcap'>W</span>e confuse two kinds of hard work a little more than what should be an innocuous
ignorance. Hard work as an <i>imposition</i> vs a <i>side effect</i>. On the surface, they
both look similar. After all they both convey a certain level of <i>discomforting</i>
intensity to the watcher. Add to it the misguided opinions implying more or less
effort necessarily means better output and the situation becomes a heavy mess.
Part of the misunderstanding comes from misreadings of the <i>intentions</i> that go
before applied effort. Rest from what comes after, in the form of <i>observed</i>
productivity. Both of these wrongly frame <i>effort</i> as the central dogma driving
productivity.
</p>

<p>
Like any other contentious topic, you can create reasonable arguments for any
side by cherry picking. In the case of making hard work a central force, stories
of <i>achievers</i> work well. And these are then accepted by us without much
resistance since we look for <i>actionables</i> without getting involved in the process
of developing them. While it is not different from other popular
misunderstandings, there are deeper issues concerning the mental and physical
effects of adages flowering under it.
</p>

<p>
In this post, I will try to lay down why I feel our current way of <i>observing</i> raw
effort spent, a.k.a. hard work, is at best immature and at worst a gross
misunderstanding of the process of creating something truly meaningful.
</p>

<p>
There are no new ideas here. Just a series of observations and thoughts.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-observance" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-observance"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Observance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-observance">

<p>
Some time back I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15799151-daily-rituals">Daily Rituals: How Artists Work</a> <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> which documents routines
of famous artists and creators. Even though the work merely catalogues schedules
and is not meant to be prescriptive, I will cherry pick a few pieces that have
potential to circulate around as bits of <i>you-should-do-this</i> wisdom.
</p>

<p>
At the very first level, and arguably the most common, we have the
spend-20-hours-a-day working style:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
…he only needed three hours of sleep. He’d get up early and write letters,
mathematical letters. He’d sleep downstairs. The first time he stayed, the clock
was set wrong. It said 7:00, but it was really 4:30 A.M. He thought we should be
up working, so he turned on the TV full blast. Later, when he knew me better,
he’d come up at some early hour and tap on the bedroom door. “Ralph, do you
exist?” The pace was grueling. He’d want to work from 8:00 A.M. until 1:30 A.M.
Sure we’d break for short meals but we’d write on napkins and talk math the
whole time. He’d stay a week or two and you’d collapse at the end.
</p>

<footer>﻿On Paul Erdős</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then a little rarer, but still misused are bits where we hint at understanding
hard work as a <i>side effect</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I work every day. I work weekends, I work nights.… [S]ome people looking at that
from the outside might use that modern term “workaholic,” or might see this as
obsessive or destructive. But it’s not work to me, it’s just what I do, that’s
my life
</p>

<footer>﻿Stephen Jay Gould</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>
A little less hours:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When I am working on a book or a story I write every morning as soon after first
light as possible. There is no one to disturb you and it is cool or cold and you
come to your work and warm as you write. You read what you have written and, as
you always stop when you know what is going to happen next, you go on from
there. You write until you come to a place where you still have your juice and
know what will happen next and you stop and try to live through until the next
day when you hit it again. You have started at six in the morning, say, and may
go on until noon or be through before that. When you stop you are as empty, and
at the same time never empty but filling, as when you have made love to someone
you love. Nothing can hurt you, nothing can happen, nothing means anything until
the next day when you do it again. It is the wait until that next day that is
hard to get through.
</p>

<p>
Lesser even:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The first, and best, of his work periods began at 8:00 A.M., after Darwin had
taken a short walk and had a solitary breakfast. Following ninety minutes of
focused work in his study—disrupted only by occasional trips to the snuff jar
that he kept on a table in the hallway—Darwin met his wife, Emma, in the drawing
room to receive the day’s post&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
At 10:30 Darwin returned to his study and did more work until noon or a quarter
after. He considered this the end of his workday, and would often remark in a
satisfied voice, “I’ve done a good day’s work.”&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
He came back downstairs at 4:00 to embark on his third walk of the day, which
lasted for half an hour, and then returned to his study for another hour of
work, tying up any loose ends from earlier in the day&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
After two games of backgammon, he would read a scientific book and, just before
bed, lie on the sofa and listen to Emma play the piano. He left the drawing room
at about 10:00 and was in bed within a half-hour, although he generally had
trouble getting to sleep and would often lie awake for hours, his mind working
at some problem that he had failed to solve during the day.
</p>

<aside id="orge7e2786">
<p>
As a side note, the differences are not <i>just</i> because of the differences in field
of work. Try searching for G.H. Hardy's stance on the topic.
</p>
</aside>

<p>
Hopefully, just counting working hours as something <i>meaningful</i> looks too
shallow. You can still argue about a few things but nothing as conclusive as
this title → <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/46/balance/darwin-was-a-slacker-and-you-should-be-too">You Should Work Less Hours—Darwin Did</a>. Our obsession with exact
answers to the question <i>What should I do?</i> makes most of the metric focused
analyses of productivity vulnerable to dramatic misinterpretations. While the
article does more in-depth analysis that its title suggests, the popular
takeaway will still be about lesser hours. Similarly, I can find supportive
content for any of the quoted texts and come out reasonably convinced that I now
know <i>the</i> way everyone should work.
</p>

<p>
Hours spent is an intermediate cause and effect in the chain of creation, not a
primary one. Most of the justifications of this being the primary force are
superficial. Reading a log of achievements backward and stopping early misses
out so much in terms of context as to basically become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-intentions" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-intentions"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Intentions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-intentions">

<p>
Other than observing yield, reading input intentions behind effort is also a
piece which we err in. Intent behind effort can be put on a rough scale of
<i>direct personal</i> meaning involved in the act. Here is a qualitative effort vs
meaning plot:
</p>


<figure id="orga8475b7">
<img src="./output.png" alt="output.png" width="400px">

</figure>

<p>
The uninteresting (and healthy) case is when you dedicate effort on something
meaningful, the top right of the plot<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
More interesting are the following two cases and the trajectory they take to go
to top right:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Top left. You have meaning but not proportionately enough effort.</li>
<li>Bottom right. You are putting in effort without meaning.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In first, the effort comes <i>after</i> the meaning. To get to the healthy zone you
tend to pull in discipline, either on your own or using various forms of
guidance. The aim for putting in effort is clearly for self improvement,
something you are closely connected to. Even the more rigorous effort tracking
attempts don't hurt here.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
He tracked his daily word output on a chart—“so as not to kid myself,” he said.
</p>

<footer>﻿On Ernest Hemingway</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the second, you try to move up by constructing a sort of meaning using a
borrowed vocabulary. This is mostly due to certain direct imposition of absolute
effort values. Some of these can be good and are important in the early training
process for a person, under proper mentoring. But most are just
one-size-fits-all <i>rules</i> applied after seeing success with similar mechanism
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
These two trajectories have wildly different impacts even though they might show
similar yields in short term and confirm our faulty intuitions about effort.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-effects-at-large" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-effects-at-large"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Effects at large</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-effects-at-large">

<p>
Even the most extreme productivity and effort related moves do little or no harm
at personal level<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>. You try little of this and that, then you replace whatever didn't work.
This works well for things in your control but there always will be things that
are not in your control. Specially in <i>partial meritocratic</i> <sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> structures in which most of us find ourselves, where people
affecting you don't have complete understanding of various aspects of your work
style.
</p>

<p>
Because we <i>think</i> effort directly relates to yield and don't try to differentiate
the backing intentions, we end up directly imposing hard work wherever possible.
Many of the cases of work related stress and dissatisfaction can be mapped to
such meaningless imposition of effort. The impacts range from suboptimal
creative output to deeper, long term and more indirect personal and societal
issues.
</p>

<p>
I recently saw this Github repository → <a href="https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU">996.ICU</a> supporting a case against
unusually long working hours in China. While this is an extreme example, you can
find many similar but milder cases which don't respect the personal dynamics of
effort. All of them have the following more fundamental problems:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>organizational disconnects leading to disproportionately less meaning in work
compared to effort</li>
<li>immature/wrong management imposing disproportionately high effort</li>
<li>wrong people in wrong jobs<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>
Fetishism with imposed working hours and community counterattacks is not a new
thing and has decent history going back, at least, to the industrial revolution.
From what I understand, few of these are intentional and justify themselves by
putting various <i>kinds</i> of work on a creativity spectrum. These can be read as
being fantastically practical or cruelly discriminative. I am not knowledgeable
enough to choose sides here. I am also not worried about these few, but about
the <i>rest who follow</i> without having built an original and situated ideology about
work themselves. By definition, the <i>rest</i> cover and impact a major segment of
real world populace, a segment where the popular definitions of work, life, etc.
are forged. And it's in the popular definitions that subtle confusions cause the
most trouble.
</p>

<p>
I concede that thinking in terms of above points might sound borderline utopian.
It might be too late to avoid talking about hours at all and achieve a sort of
global work renaissance now. But amidst all the practical arguments and
counterarguments, we also need to question our stances on the fundamental points
which define what is and should be the meaning of work itself.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Of course you need to put effort to produce things, but it's not what <i>primarily</i>
produces great outcomes. Hours spent is something that takes care of itself in
the chain of creation and needs no independent push. This means that talking
about and promoting formulations of effort is meaningless unless they are
consumed in an experimental setting aimed to improve personal workflows.
</p>

<p>
What does produce great outcomes though? I don't know. Not at the moment. But
this <i>uncertainty</i> is still meaningful, specially when dealing with <i>other</i> people
in a team like environment. Not respecting this creates an environment of
unhealthy machismo surrounding the amount of hours spent which is really hard to
break out from.

<p>
Talking about teams, organizational work these days have another dimension of
competitiveness which inflates short term gains. <a class="pile-link" href="/journal/2018/02/14/lazy-answer.html">Lazy solutions</a> like <i>putting
more effort</i>, along with general snowballing across attrition and renewals ends
up showing decent results with a direct causal connection which makes us even
more lazier. But we need to do better.
</p>

<p>
Getting good output from a team in a competitive setting preserving meaning is a
hard problem. Harder than most of the <i>technically</i> hard problems. This needs time
spent in careful thinking and deliberations within specific contexts the people
are in. In positions of control and influence<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>, probably the most important
responsibility for us is to <i>not</i> let ready made <i>answers</i> like 'spend more hours'
go through ourselves untouched and unturned.
