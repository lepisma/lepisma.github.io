#+TITLE: Wiki

This is my personal wiki. These pages try to organize resources and thoughts on
various topics that I tend to get involved with. Many of these pages might not
be in coherent state, but I will try to keep them sufficiently useful.

A list of all the pages in this wiki follows. See [[pile:wiki:misc/colophon][colophon]] for details on how
these pages are built.
